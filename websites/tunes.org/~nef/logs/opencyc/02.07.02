00:20:11 <dmiles> subp (findall ?X (#$or (#$isa ?X #$Dog)(#$isa ?X #$Person)) ?L)
00:20:12 <CycLBot> ?X = ?X, ?L = '(#$CycAdministrator #$Guest (#$GenericInstanceFn #$Dog))
00:21:04 <dmiles> subp (findall ?X (#$or (#$isa ?X #$Dog)(#$isa ?X Person)) ?L)

00:22:17 <dmiles> join #ai
00:22:58 <aigan> why?
00:23:51 <dmiles> oh that was a bot command.. i was in the wrong window!
00:24:14 <dmiles> it does that for anyone
00:24:33 <dmiles> normally i give it commands like that in a #logicmoo
00:24:48 <dmiles> so its not advertised it does things like that 
00:25:03 <aigan> ;)
00:25:10 <aigan> join the army
00:25:37 <dmiles> hehe
00:25:59 <dmiles> i am working on the SubP interface so i can write chatbot code
00:26:11 <dmiles> until the subL interface is more complete 
00:26:32 <aigan> the CycLBot answer to your statements above seems strange to me
00:27:33 <dmiles> 'findall' is a SubP predicate that collects first argument in executuion to make a Quotesd Cons inot last arguemnt
00:28:12 <aigan> I think I understand your questiion. But not the answer
00:28:25 <dmiles> you mean the ?X = ?X 
00:28:38 <aigan> But I doesn't understand " a Quotesd Cons inot last arguemnt"
00:28:48 <dmiles> that is becasue upon completeing ?X held a memory pointer back to ?X
00:29:11 <dmiles> oh a quoted list
00:29:25 <dmiles> quoted becasue non quoted can get evalled
00:30:22 <aigan> Shouldn't it just answer with the constants whats either person or dog?
00:30:36 <dmiles> it would in the case of..
00:30:57 <dmiles> subp: (#$or (#$isa ?X #$Dog)(#$isa ?X #$Person))
00:30:57 <CycLBot> ?X = #$CycAdministrator
00:31:20 <dmiles> but i havent created full iteration yet
00:32:30 <dmiles> ok i just did
00:32:40 <dmiles> subp: (#$or (#$isa ?X #$Dog)(#$isa ?X #$Person))
00:32:41 <CycLBot> ?X = #$CycAdministrator
00:33:26 <dmiles> oops will debug in #logicmoo
00:36:54 <dmiles> subp: (#$or (#$isa ?X #$Dog)(#$isa ?X #$Person))
00:36:55 <CycLBot> ?X = #$Guest  ?X = (#$GenericInstanceFn #$Dog)  ?X = #$CycAdministrator
00:37:03 <dmiles> ok there we go
00:37:18 <dmiles> so SubP always expoects to be in Query Mode
00:37:47 <dmiles> if an evalled preduicate starts with #$ then it calls into Cyc-Query
00:38:17 <dmiles> the SubP manual is http://www.swi.psy.uva.nl/projects/SWI-Prolog/Manual/predsummary.html
00:38:40 <dmiles> ;P its a interpretor that balances prolog and SubL and CycL interactively between each
00:40:31 <dmiles> actually acess to subL can happen from CycL with #$performSubL
00:40:53 * aigan adds more geo data to KB
00:41:47 <dmiles> cool, what language did you write the import utillity in?
00:42:15 <aigan> ... Still just experimenting
00:42:24 <aigan> But anything I write will be Perl ;)
00:42:24 <dmiles> i am working on a SubP version of DAML import
00:42:45 <dmiles> ah cool.. perl code is readable to alot of people
00:42:46 <aigan> Actually...
00:43:04 <aigan> ... have you read my posts to admin list?
00:43:24 <dmiles> whats the list name?
00:43:30 <aigan> I'm still a little unseartain about if this will work like I hope it will
00:43:36 <aigan> "Jonas Liljegren"
00:43:52 <dmiles> oh i mean i am so many lists i am loojking for list name ;P
00:44:01 <aigan> oh
00:44:15 <aigan> Opencyc-admin@sourcforge ...
00:44:43 <dmiles> oh .. thats right my subscriptions never wnet through
00:44:51 <dmiles> i should try again
00:45:14 <dmiles> it was rejecting my pop becoause its a forward
00:45:16 <aigan> Just... I got an answer that OpenCyc has a limit of 2.4 million assertions
00:45:27 <aigan> or what it's called
00:48:14 <aigan> I wanted to use OpenCyc for enabling diffrent ways of searching...  
00:48:33 <dmiles> ok i am subscribed now i think.. but cvan read on GeoCrawler
00:49:15 <aigan> Well... anyway. He suggested the relational datbase interface for larger amounts of data. And that would apply to geo data if I will add every street in the country
00:51:07 <dmiles> yes definately
00:51:22 <aigan> The thing I wonder now is that if I use such a interface, will searches still be effective...  Or will it have to loop through a lot of data or repeat stuff.  I don't know how it will infere things form the DB and cache that if it's from relational database
00:51:22 <dmiles> well for something that you dont know if when it will e4xceed
00:51:59 <dmiles> well that is a good question.. becasue in this case it is at each node in inferncee
00:52:22 <dmiles> that it might have to solicit a call for connection and make a subquery
00:52:39 <dmiles> thousands of times ;P
00:53:18 <dmiles> so in this case.. maybe there can be support for caching
00:53:28 <dmiles> like you could make a priming query first
00:53:43 <aigan> It doesn't bother me if it makes a lot of queries.  As long as the number of queries isn't exponentialy larger than for OpenCyc internally
00:54:29 <dmiles> a priming query would be like (#$isa ?X #$Country)
00:54:39 <aigan> Let's take an example...
00:54:58 <aigan> Would Cyc cache all countries then?
00:55:14 <dmiles> thats would be the idea
00:55:33 <aigan> Example:  We have 5000 hotels spread over a couple of hundred cities
00:55:58 <aigan> And I would as for hotels in a specific region.  And the DB holds info of the city for the hotel
00:56:20 <aigan> It would have to infere the cities in the region and then fetch the hotels for those cities
00:57:39 <aigan> That would be in combination wit criterions about the type of hotel, and those data would possibly also be in an external DB.
00:57:44 <dmiles> so would that happen with a JOIN inside and #$and rule ?
00:57:52 <dmiles> yeah.. following
00:58:45 <dmiles> you could create JOINs for ceraibn types of infernce
00:58:57 <dmiles> but going on without that first
00:59:16 <aigan> join?
00:59:23 <dmiles> your saying the (#$and q1 q2 q3) 
00:59:29 <aigan> yes
00:59:40 <dmiles> the qX each would be an external call
00:59:54 <dmiles> that cyc may chose to evaluate left to right
01:00:16 <dmiles> with the first binding of the first presented to the second
01:00:26 <dmiles> then so on
01:00:36 <aigan> so if you start witn "is a hotel" the result of the first part would be a long list
01:00:55 <dmiles> well at lerast that list would prove productive and cheap
01:01:23 <aigan> how?
01:01:27 <aigan> It's much to long
01:01:36 <aigan> The number of hotels is much to large
01:01:43 <dmiles> so lets say the second was Hotel in City
01:01:48 <aigan> it should start with the group with the least number of members in it
01:01:58 <dmiles> so maybe the Sencond might be more effiecint?
01:02:10 <aigan> like "part of City Klabusk"
01:02:14 <dmiles> or at least we cant predict the best order right?
01:02:50 <dmiles> yeah for the second
01:02:59 <aigan> Relational databases keeps statistics of these things
01:03:14 <aigan> and the optimizer choses the best order for executing the query
01:03:22 <aigan> i would hope that Cyc would do the same
01:03:33 <dmiles> so if we could combine q1 and q2 in the DB as a query we would be better off?
01:03:44 <dmiles> yes Cyc does a best effor
01:04:06 <dmiles> ti think it actually would ignore (#$isa ?X #$Hotel)
01:04:21 <dmiles> since the arg1Isa of q2 would allready enforce it
01:04:33 <aigan> Now it's start sounding that I can't excpe the complexity.  I could do my own DB. :-/
01:04:50 <aigan> ... no
01:05:03 <aigan> We will have a lot of things in the city apart of lodgings
01:05:14 <dmiles> ok i like that case your presenting better
01:05:26 <dmiles> (the case you have been all along :)
01:05:26 <aigan> There would be trains stations, airports, tourist attractions
01:05:42 <dmiles> ok so lets say we did enumerate hotels first
01:06:05 <dmiles> then maybe cyc would iteratively test each hotel
01:06:29 <dmiles> for the part of city.. and call that next
01:06:56 <dmiles> so maybe the DB could have a View of hotels_to_city
01:07:15 <dmiles> and you could bind that to a predicate such as hotelsInCity
01:07:43 <dmiles> but i see thats extra work that you shoulnt have had to do
01:08:15 <dmiles> maining it sounds like you looking for a solution that makes more sense
01:08:43 <dmiles> perhaps a forward chain rule that caches the (#$isa ?X #$Hoitel)
01:08:57 <aigan> ....
01:09:15 <aigan> I had read that Cyc has a lot of internal links in both directions
01:09:26 <aigan> And that's how I myself implemented similar systems
01:09:46 <aigan> I would certainly want indexes
01:09:48 <dmiles> (implies (#$inDb #$HotelTable ?X "Hotel") (#$isa ?X #$Hotel))
01:09:58 <aigan> It shouldnt have to iterate through the hotels
01:10:24 <dmiles> rigth definattly
01:11:11 <dmiles> so picking the most optimnal representation.. to ballance Cyc work vs DB work .. thats the goal right?
01:11:23 <aigan> If I have objects (lodgins, geo data) in external DB. The calls to it would be for the combinations of things... Oh
01:11:55 <dmiles> right so the goal is to get the best most complete way to get ahold of things
01:12:03 <dmiles> anything of course
01:12:20 <aigan> Oh... We don't realy know what properties of the wuery that's primary and what are infered.  It would have to go through each hotel. But after that,the result should be cached
01:12:50 <dmiles> yes.. so you would want to impleiment a cache with a subsumption check
01:13:28 <dmiles> i implemetned that in SubP where some resulkts from Cyc are cached
01:13:35 <aigan> There can I read documentation on the caching?
01:13:52 <dmiles> well there is no docs for any system yet :P
01:14:22 <dmiles> in subP i just keep a cache of what i've caches and test a query to see if it was more specific then any cache
01:14:46 <dmiles> if so i use that more general cache with a unification over varaibles
01:15:05 <dmiles> to do this in Cyc.. i only know how from forward chaining
01:15:06 <aigan> You implement your own cache?
01:15:11 <dmiles> i did yes
01:15:46 <dmiles> from forward chaining in cyc you can create a query cache
01:15:58 <aigan> That was also a thing I would hope Cyc would do.  I'm starting to loose my reasons for switching system
01:16:17 <dmiles> well you can manullay set up a cache in opencyc
01:16:38 <dmiles> but there is no documentation on it
01:16:42 <dmiles> so i use...
01:17:02 <aigan> I was hoping I could do everything in cyc.  I want the system that knows about the world.  That can grow and grow and grow
01:17:14 <aigan> 2.4 million feels like a big limitation
01:17:16 <dmiles> (fi-assert '(#$implies (#$inDb #$HotelTable ?X "Hotel") (#$isa ?X #$Hotel)) #$MySpindel '(:DIRECTION :forward))
01:17:37 <aigan> But I will probably not use more than 500.000 to start with
01:18:01 <dmiles> that would mainting a cahced version of (#$isa ?X #$Hotel)
01:18:19 <dmiles> #$inDb would be some SubL function defined
01:18:28 <dmiles> that would call into the actual database
01:18:50 <dmiles> and since its forward the consquent becomes cached
01:19:07 <aigan> And then you could have inte in the DB all along
01:19:14 <aigan> Not using an external DB
01:19:16 <dmiles> correct
01:19:49 <aigan> I would use external DB only for things not searchable.
01:20:02 <dmiles> correct
01:20:20 <dmiles> when rthe db cache needs rereading you use fi-reassert
01:20:25 <aigan> Maby condense info to metadata and put that in Cyc. 
01:21:18 <dmiles> yes
01:21:44 <aigan> Now I spent a lot of agonizing over limitations.  Now back to testing.  
01:21:46 <dmiles> if you wanted to make it more controled from Cyc thats when you could use a forward chaining rule
01:22:08 <dmiles> so cyc would automatically cache metadata
01:22:10 <aigan> I would like to do test with larger amount of data but would like the Perl module for that,
01:22:45 <dmiles> to call an external DB from cyc should be easy to write for 0.7

02:39:05 <aigan> Geography is complex.
02:42:12 <aigan> We have Political Geography
02:42:17 <aigan> Natural Geography
02:42:25 <aigan> and Geogrpahy Dualist
02:42:36 <aigan> But... What about the postal geography?
02:42:41 <aigan> it's not political
02:42:47 <aigan> neither natural
02:43:07 <aigan> It reflects the postal organisation
02:43:19 <aigan> So in a sence, geography dualist
02:43:23 <aigan> sense
02:46:20 <aigan> I guess I could define the notion of City-postal in DualistGeopoliticalVocabularyMt
02:49:10 <aigan> it's not political but the definition says more about agents.
02:56:07 <aigan> Do'h!
02:56:30 <aigan> City is defined as geopolitical entity
02:56:33 <aigan> AND urban area
02:56:41 <aigan> neither is true for Sweden
02:57:44 <aigan> I'll have to define my own properties City and municipality
02:59:58 <aigan> I'm starting to think I should create my own properties and worry about their connection to the ontology later

03:46:17 <aigan> These error msgs can be pretty long
03:46:31 <dmiles> but uit uses the <nick>ChatMt
03:46:50 <dmiles> so each user has there own
03:47:00 <dmiles> yeah i am going to make it msg those instead
03:47:15 <dmiles> and an in channel message that they need to check their message window
03:47:43 <dmiles> that way the channel isnt so spammed ;P
03:48:35 <dmiles> but a user can change out of mt with "mt: <MtNaem>"
03:48:40 <aigan> Maby "join #opencyc-bots" ;)
03:48:44 <dmiles> so there assertions can go to where they need
03:48:55 <dmiles> yeah
03:49:10 <dmiles> otherwise the user will pput the bot on ignore in BitchX
03:49:22 <aigan> Anyway.  An error should promptt clarification
03:49:25 <dmiles> when it messages that much
03:49:34 <aigan> The bot should answer "Huh?!". 
03:49:58 <aigan> Not that long thing. :)
03:50:41 <aigan> Most of the time you can refrase the question without explanation
03:50:49 <aigan> rephrase (?)
03:50:57 <dmiles> yeah.. well i think cyccorp is working on maybe some kind of engish explainion maye of errors
03:51:20 <dmiles> yes
03:51:55 <aigan> Can I make a sub-Mt and redefine classes?
03:52:10 <aigan> Or how should I present the Swedish notion of city?
03:52:53 <dmiles> you can use a differnt constant.. or CreateSImpular first
03:53:00 <dmiles> err create simular
03:53:07 <dmiles> then remove the things you want
03:53:42 <dmiles> what is it about City you do not want?
03:53:52 <aigan> ah. Yes. So I should use two Mts?  One under WorldGeography and one under WorldGeographyDualist
03:54:14 <dmiles> you can also exclude Mts from your Mt that say things about City you dont want
03:54:51 <aigan> I can't exclude it if I inherit WorldGeography...
03:55:16 <dmiles> WorldGeographyDualistMt lifts assertions from WorldGeographyMt
03:55:46 <dmiles> so if you genlMt WorldGeographyMt you wont get WorldGeographyDualistMt
03:55:52 <aigan> I know.  You sean my diagram?
03:56:16 <aigan> That's why I asked if I should have one for each
03:56:16 <dmiles> on the list?
03:56:33 <aigan> Or could I just inherit the dualist, even for things not dualistic
03:56:37 <aigan> dmiles: yes
03:56:45 <dmiles> looking now
03:57:17 <aigan> I tried to understand the system and draw all geo stuff
03:57:37 <dmiles> the web interface does not include the image
03:57:45 <dmiles> can you sendf to dmiles@users.so
03:58:17 <aigan> done
03:59:23 <dmiles> odd normally i would have it by now
03:59:44 <dmiles> dmiles@users.sourceforge.net
03:59:53 <dmiles> sorry
04:00:25 <aigan> done - 2
04:00:31 <aigan> brb
04:01:44 <dmiles> when you return let me know ehre you want you Mt to lift from
04:02:51 <dmiles> normally whenever i do something i create one Mt to query from and set up a genlMt to places i want
04:03:52 <dmiles> so in this case yoiu asked about two Mts.. i always do that
04:04:40 <dmiles> that allows the other Mts to evlove over time
04:04:59 <dmiles> another thing is you can genlMt those Mts to yours and work from InferncePSC
04:10:02 <aigan> .
04:11:04 <dmiles> you can assert your Mt (or Mts) into mulitple places in that tree
04:11:35 <dmiles> since you would want to inherit more then one vocabulary
04:11:51 <dmiles> at least maybe
04:11:52 <aigan> Ok... The placement in Mts is mainly about visability in reasoning
04:12:01 <dmiles> yes
04:12:17 <aigan> So I could in this case just genls the most general geographic Mt and put all geo stuff there
04:12:45 <aigan> But that would not be consistent with the structure
04:13:09 <aigan> Te comments specify where each thing should go
04:13:19 <dmiles> you need to inherit maybe to mutilple Vocabs
04:13:20 <aigan> and I would be placing them in the wrong places
04:13:49 <dmiles> well you may need three Mts .. for each type
04:14:01 <dmiles> then link those three appropriately
04:14:06 <aigan> ah
04:14:09 <aigan> why?
04:14:20 <aigan> is the type of Mt used in any way in reasoning?
04:14:34 <aigan> it seams that some MTs have the wrong type of data in them
04:14:38 <dmiles> becasue you have both a major vocabulary change i thought you where saying
04:14:41 <aigan> the dualist Mt seems more lika a theory mt
04:14:49 <aigan> but it's typed as a data mt
04:15:00 <dmiles> yeah Dulist is Theory
04:15:10 <dmiles> oh right
04:15:16 <aigan> no
04:15:20 <dmiles> yellows are theory
04:15:23 <dmiles> ?
04:15:24 <aigan> the dualist heiarcy goes all the way
04:15:30 <aigan> from vocab to data
04:15:38 <aigan> yellow theory yes
04:16:06 <dmiles> ok make sense so when one makes a query.. they do it in the Data
04:16:07 <aigan> I think I have a better understanging of the structure from the image
04:16:14 <aigan> yes
04:16:27 <aigan> But the US Mt is misplaced it seems
04:16:36 <dmiles> so you would want the normal Data to inherit yours
04:16:55 <aigan> It's inconsistent to have specific US things anyway. But if it's only one, it should be under dualist
04:16:58 <dmiles> (your DataMt
04:17:21 <aigan> ... For one thing:
04:17:38 <aigan> The discription of Scandinavia says that it includes Sweden, Norway and Denmark
04:17:48 <aigan> But those countries has been removed from OpenCyc
04:17:51 <dmiles> well the assertions in opencyc are not consitant on where they are places yet
04:17:51 <aigan> I replaced them
04:18:05 <aigan> and I added the statement about them being part of Scandinavia
04:18:15 <dmiles> since there are vocabulary in Data right now
04:18:15 <aigan> That info does belon in the main Cyc
04:18:44 <dmiles> yeah alot of things were shreded out
04:18:49 <aigan> It seems to me that the conversion is incomplete
04:18:58 <aigan> But I think I see the general design here
04:19:13 <dmiles> yes.. becasue normal cyc never had these three type iin their organization
04:19:25 <aigan> I can't udnerstand why a handful of countres were left in
04:19:38 <dmiles> they used GeneralMicrothery for Theory+Data
04:19:40 <aigan> Then those contries are insanely inconsistently categorised
04:19:50 <aigan> All over the place...
04:20:00 <dmiles> yeah its a mess ;P
04:20:24 <dmiles> and lots of commetns reveal missing constants
04:20:37 <aigan> I haven't got an answer about how fixes of the KB is handled
04:20:58 <dmiles> well what i have been doing to work arround it...
04:21:07 <dmiles> is i create 3 Mts for myself
04:21:09 <aigan> It doesn't make sense to add countries if they already exist in main Cyc and will come next year
04:21:32 <dmiles> then i use #$ist anteceedant rules and forward cahin
04:21:33 <aigan> Yes. I like the comments
04:21:46 <aigan> They makes it easier to recreate the data
04:21:51 <dmiles> so into one Mt i gather only what i wanted
04:22:00 <aigan> ... It should be rather simple to import most of the things from CIA World Factbook
04:22:12 <aigan> Then you would at least have the countries back
04:22:15 <dmiles> yes since its mostly a DataMt
04:22:44 <aigan> how large is Cyc?  They say OpenCyc is about 100.000 relations
04:23:10 <aigan> I wan't the semantic Web
04:23:23 <aigan> I want to integrate all sorts of data in diffrent categories
04:23:28 <aigan> maby not in the samd DB
04:23:33 <aigan> But connected
04:23:35 <aigan> as services
04:23:52 <aigan> and it should do reasoning using all availible services
04:24:41 <aigan> Well... Another thing is that the definitions of things seems to be US centric.  
04:24:47 <dmiles> you saw? http://www-ksl-svc.stanford.edu:5915/doc/hpkb/index.html
04:24:58 <aigan> Why is it that Scotland is a nonfree country and Alabama is just a state? ;)
04:25:25 <dmiles> Cyc2 dirrectory contains alot of missing info
04:26:44 <dmiles> it looks lik ein opencyc that customer paid knowl;edge was tried to be taken out
04:26:48 <aigan> oh.. Ok.  I have a deadline ... Must finish today.  So for experimentation, I will just create my own Mt and put things there
04:27:03 <dmiles> however it would have torn up too much to take some of it out
04:27:28 <dmiles> so what they *had* to leave there for opencyc is all thats left
04:27:46 <aigan> We should just set up a way to organize knowledge entry
04:28:00 <aigan> and a way to check its quality
04:28:06 <dmiles> then things went through a reorganiztion into the three Mts system.. but very inc0omplete
04:28:45 <dmiles> so i try to import ddata but not try to leverage whats there
04:28:59 <dmiles> unless its a Collection or Rule
04:29:06 <dmiles> (or a predicate)
04:29:18 <aigan> What is it in there that you doesn't import?
04:29:20 <aigan> brbr
04:29:22 <aigan> brb
04:29:48 <dmiles> things for me that would send inference on a search that wont lead to the answers i want
04:30:06 <dmiles> basicly istances of first order collections
04:31:22 <dmiles> PartiallyTangable instances
04:32:25 <dmiles> yeah for getting done quickly i would do that.. and only use or genl to existing VocabMts
04:32:50 <dmiles> so you dont have to create your own Collections or Predicates
04:33:31 <dmiles> and genlMt towards theoryMtas you like
04:34:14 <dmiles> since you are noticing a high inconstancy with DataMts
04:35:24 <dmiles> its just gets rough when a predicate or collection you really wanted was in something like WorldGeographyMt
04:35:51 <dmiles> so you are stuck Taking it's parent
04:36:11 <dmiles> then have to replcate the same assertions
04:36:21 <dmiles> of the child

05:05:31 <aigan> i found a strange effect in the browser

05:11:01 <aigan> the good news was that you went away ;)
05:11:12 <aigan> Now i can.. yezz yezz yess, youre back!
05:11:40 <aigan> Ok... I use the KB browser to add info
05:11:49 <aigan> And i just added an assertion
05:12:00 <aigan> and went back too look att the constant
05:12:08 <aigan> And it didn't have the assertion
05:12:21 <aigan> But then I refreshed the page it came up
05:12:47 <aigan> ... meaning: I run in and got another page before the assertion got comitted
05:12:48 <dmiles> excellent
05:13:05 <aigan> That's sort of a bug
05:13:24 <dmiles> that the asseertions slowing go in?
05:13:41 <dmiles> they have to get indexed
05:13:45 <aigan> Things should wue up within the session. At least if its anything doing with previous actions
05:14:07 <aigan> queu up
05:14:25 <aigan> ... another thing came up just now:
05:15:22 <aigan> I used the "create similar".  And then "copy assertions" to copy assertions. But they got created within their existing Mt.
05:15:54 <aigan> ... I wanted them to be placed in my new Mt.  Now I have to move them by hand.
05:18:47 <aigan> Do'h!  They are impossible
05:19:15 <aigan> I created a new  GeographicalEntityByHierarchy instance
05:19:34 <aigan> But they insisted it should be a governing heiacy
05:19:53 <aigan> And now I have to create my own GeographicalEntityByHierarchy that's not political
05:20:38 <aigan> I have previously studied the top ontology nad liked it
05:21:11 <aigan> But will I find that everything in Opencyc is wrong? :-/
05:29:25 <aigan> I'll go with SpatiallyDisjointRegionType and forget about the hiearchy
06:37:16 <aigan> question...:  I have defined Municipality as isa : [Mon]SpatiallyDisjointRegionType [Mon]GeographicalEntityByHierarchy
06:37:40 <aigan> Why do I have to define it as genls : [Def]GeographicalRegion also?  Shouldn't it infere that?
06:39:17 <aigan> or for that case geopolitical entity...
06:56:40 <aigan> I misinterpretated inRegion
06:58:28 <aigan> thought it would be transitive

08:44:36 <yepster> (knows ((not knows a1) or (not knows a2)))   +  (knows a2)

08:53:41 <yepster> would this kind of hack work?
08:57:17 <aigan> Hasn't this type of problem been solved in a previous Cyc project?
08:58:05 <yepster> which kind?
08:58:28 <yepster> I am in desperate need of more information!
08:59:10 <aigan> Iäm novice.  Don't depend on me
08:59:31 <aigan> Are you trying to tell Cyc what things it doesn't know?
08:59:38 <yepster> yes
09:00:04 <yepster> to answer questions like 'why is x not proven?'
09:00:15 <aigan> You are separating between truth, falsity and insufficient information?
09:00:32 <aigan> oh
09:00:36 <yepster> yes, because if things are false, they are know (to be false)
09:01:35 <aigan> Hm.. If it can't find an answer. How will it know what bit of information is missing?  The answer could come through a multitude of ways
09:01:50 <yepster> yes, combinatoric explosion
09:02:21 <yepster> but this 'explosion' is bound by the parameters of 'x' in 'why is x not proven'
09:02:33 <aigan> You would have to provide some kind of template telling what information is expected to be availible?
09:02:41 <yepster> it's impossible to ask for e.g. (not knows Cyc ?x)
09:03:36 <yepster> well I am using implies rules for that
09:03:40 <aigan> I don't think asking about a part of the problem solves the question. Each part is the same as the whole
09:04:07 <yepster> (implies antecedent consequent) : if consequent not proven that means knows (not knows antecedent)
09:04:38 <yepster> and the (knows (not knows antecedent) is in the form of a1 and a2 and so on
09:05:17 <yepster> I think it comes down to whether cyc can solve 
09:05:48 <yepster> something I can't cut and past from a few lines ago..
09:09:34 * aigan pans out ... to lazy to think
09:11:46 <aigan> I don't know if I'm in a minority here.
09:12:15 <aigan> Maby not...  Just reflecting that the problem I want to solve are rather easy
09:12:34 <aigan> The hard part is to model the world correctly
09:21:05 <yepster> to model the world exact enough to be able to answer questions you want answered
09:32:54 <aigan> I'm not sure what types of question I could want to have answerd later
09:33:39 <aigan> But just to place the model in the existing ontology is a big help
09:35:28 <aigan> I just now defined #$ServiceProvidor
09:37:37 <aigan> And have to think about localized availible services and nonlocal stuff.  I got a little help from the existing examples of ServiceEstablishment and related terms
10:05:24 <yepster> cool it works!

12:26:52 <aigan> ... is there a missing rule somewhere?
12:32:38 <dmiles> does spatiallyRelatedTo include subRegions?
12:32:58 <aigan> Let me show what I have.
12:33:11 <dmiles> subRegions seems a good way to say one place is inside anohter
12:34:04 <dmiles> yes do that
12:34:15 <dmiles> oh, internalSubRegions is actually better
12:34:17 <aigan> subRegions works for the heiarcy of regions
12:35:01 * aigan looks
12:35:05 <dmiles> since internalSubRegions impoies the surfice is open area
12:35:31 <aigan> internalSubRegions doesn't work at all
12:35:37 <dmiles> why?
12:35:51 <aigan> i don't know
12:36:00 <dmiles> oh for query?
12:36:04 <aigan> Here is what i have:
12:36:05 <dmiles> i meant for assertion
12:36:13 <aigan> (#$subRegions #$Sweden ?X)

12:38:58 <aigan> (geographicalSubRegions Goteborg-Municipality Goteborg)
12:39:23 <aigan> And this is the last part:

12:41:33 <dmiles> is my best gueess
12:41:34 <aigan> I made a search for spatial transitive predicates 
12:42:05 <dmiles> if a parent is transitive.. hrm is it's child?
12:42:06 <aigan> .. or maby something more basic than permanentLocationOfObject. Let me look
12:43:30 <dmiles> oh actually (genlInvers in this case)

12:45:06 <CycLBot> "This predicate relates some instance of #$SpatialThing-Localized with where that object is most commonly or permanently found .

12:46:18 <dmiles> what is genlInverse?
12:47:08 <dmiles> you could assert (genlInverse permanentLocationOfObject ...)
12:47:27 <dmiles> the ... would be the best childd of subRegions you see
12:47:47 <dmiles> that way you will find it
12:48:28 <dmiles> you understand what i am saying?
12:49:03 <aigan> not yet.  Looking at subRegions.  But I think i know what genlInverse is.
12:50:32 <aigan> hmm. Maby not know what genlInverse is. ... thinking
12:50:56 <dmiles> it means that the two predicates are companible when you switch the argument order arround
12:51:26 <aigan> yes. that was it. Read about it.  The arg1Isa : [R]BinaryPredicate gave a clue
12:52:04 <aigan> so I should find the reverse pred for permanentLocationOfObject
12:52:13 <dmiles> exacly
12:52:26 <dmiles> somewhere belows holdsIn
12:52:29 <dmiles> oops
12:52:38 <dmiles> somewhere bellow subRegions ;P
12:52:51 <aigan> [R]SpatialThing-Localized
12:53:11 <aigan> That is more generic than surface
12:53:15 <dmiles> yes 
12:53:25 <dmiles> becasue it more part of spactial vocabulary
12:53:45 <dmiles> but the contraints on subRegions will keep your domains straght
12:54:30 <dmiles> so subRegions will slurp up only permanentLocationOfObject that make sense to it
12:55:30 <aigan> I came to inRegion now. Following SpatialThing
12:57:06 <aigan> inRegion is inverse... 
12:57:26 <aigan> But it defines negationPreds
12:57:34 <aigan> But that's somthing else?
13:00:43 <aigan> Hmm... Now I wonder
13:00:58 <aigan> maby inRegion means that the object IS there
13:01:19 <aigan> but permanentLocationOfObject doesn't say that
13:01:50 <aigan> soo (genlInverse permanentLocationOfObject inRegion) would not be right?
13:03:47 <aigan> a subclas. for example physicalQuarters, genls parts
13:03:57 <aigan> That parts is what is neded, I think
13:06:00 <aigan> Instead, what i need is to find (#$permanentLocationOfObject ?X #$Sweden)
13:06:01 --- quit: people (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
13:06:15 <aigan> I should construct a rule that fives the right answer to that question
13:06:23 <aigan> that gives...
13:08:48 <aigan> dmiles: I think this could be it:
13:09:11 <aigan> permanentLocationOfObject genls spatiallyRelatedTo
13:09:45 <aigan> and something spatially related to Goteborg should also be spatially related to Sweden
13:09:48 <aigan> doesn't it?
13:12:08 <aigan> Just for things including other things. Not in the other direction
13:13:17 <aigan> ... or it could be safer to use  hasBeenIn. since that mentions inRegion
13:20:24 <dmiles>  spatiallyRelatedTo  is too geral for subregions
13:20:44 <dmiles> at least in my opionion becasue is a ReflexiveBinaryPredicate
13:20:53 <aigan> yes...
13:21:25 <aigan> I'm thinking that.. looking ar hasBeenIn
13:21:48 <dmiles> what is hasBeenIn?
13:21:49 <CycLBot> "A predicate linking a thing to its prior history ; ( #$hasBeenIn OBJECT PLACE ) means that the thing OBJECT has at one time during its lifetime been in ( in the general sense of #$inRegion ) the thing PLACE ."
13:22:09 <aigan> genls permanentLocationOfObject hasBeenIn
13:22:18 <dmiles> look like a specialization that adds time base infernce
13:22:24 <aigan> The important part is that it doesn't say that the ting actually is in the region
13:22:29 <dmiles> oh right much better
13:22:43 <aigan> but it does relate to the region
13:23:38 <aigan> (#$and 
13:23:39 <aigan>   (#$permanentLocationOfObject ?X ?Y) 
13:23:39 <aigan>   (#$subRegions #$Sweden ?Y))
13:23:42 <aigan> This work!!!
13:23:50 <dmiles> (genlInverse hasBeenIn internalSubRegions)
13:24:11 <aigan> dmiles: I don't think that is right
13:24:32 <aigan> internalSubRegions talks about the actual spatial relation
13:24:45 <dmiles> well its not right for time modality.. but for a constant state it is
13:25:24 <dmiles> right it means that it is completely subsummed by region
13:25:29 <aigan> It feels a little bit wrong. Is thera any way to do this right?
13:25:44 <dmiles> subRegion is too general
13:26:05 <dmiles> unless you want to say that something can be in two regions not inside each other
13:26:34 <dmiles> (++(**)--)
13:26:51 <dmiles> those are both subRegions of each other
13:26:54 <aigan> the thing can be at one place
13:26:58 <aigan> but hasBeen at another
13:27:28 <aigan> Think of it as a rental car
13:27:41 <dmiles> the insideSubReggions means (---(****)---)
13:28:23 <dmiles> oh soory i was wrong
13:28:45 <dmiles> lies wholly within the region SUPER (see inRegion). SUPER might or might not completely surround SUB
13:29:08 <aigan> In some way we should expand the notion of hasBeenIn so that it mimic #$subRegions
13:29:11 <dmiles> well i just dont see how insideSubRegions is wrong
13:29:31 <dmiles> (genlInverse hasBeenIn subRegions)
13:29:37 <dmiles> thats would do it
13:30:41 <dmiles> that would collect permanentLocationOfObject into subRegions
13:30:56 <aigan> I'll try.
13:31:30 <dmiles> if it doesnt work then its a bug or the backchaining needs to be incremebnted 1 higher
13:33:44 <aigan> not workning
13:33:55 <dmiles> what mt did you place it in?
13:34:12 <aigan> Mt : NaiveSpatialVocabularyMt
13:34:29 <dmiles> hrrm but they can see each other i dont think
13:34:34 <dmiles> err cant see
13:35:49 <dmiles> it needs to be a place that has subRegions
13:36:00 <dmiles> (as well)
13:36:31 <aigan> explain
13:36:58 <dmiles> your query is for subRegions Sweden ?X right?
13:37:20 <aigan> (#$permanentLocationOfObject ?X #$Sweden)
13:37:27 <aigan> not subregions
13:37:42 <dmiles> well it wont find it that way
13:37:45 <aigan> a permanentlocation can not be a subregion
13:37:59 <aigan> how can I get (#$permanentLocationOfObject ?X #$Sweden) to work?
13:38:12 <dmiles> hasBeen at another doesnt mean it is permanentLocationOfObject
13:38:23 <dmiles> ok what assertions do you expect tio find?
13:38:45 <aigan> Lodging-H424
13:38:49 <dmiles> permanentLocationOfObject implies hasBeenIn,, but the opposite is not ture
13:39:19 <dmiles> what was the gaf you used?
13:39:25 <aigan> [Def](permanentLocationOfObject Lodging-H424 Goteborg)
13:39:42 <dmiles> ok then thaat is what you want right?
13:39:42 <aigan> Goteborg should mean Sweden
13:39:48 <aigan> since Goteborg part of Sweden
13:39:54 <dmiles> then it has to be done diffently
13:40:15 <dmiles> i thought you where trying to get (subRegions Sweden ?X)
13:40:24 <dmiles> and find Lodging-H424
13:40:33 <aigan> That would be logically wrong
13:40:46 <dmiles> the Logding is a suiface space
13:40:56 <dmiles> for example it can have the GrandSwimmingPool
13:40:58 <aigan> lodgings yes
13:41:11 <dmiles> and you want that ppol to start showing up in Sweden for it
13:41:24 <aigan> But the general case would include rented houseboats
13:41:52 <dmiles> yes.. so then why is (subRegions Sweden Lodging-H424) bad?
13:42:19 <dmiles> (or illogical)
13:42:27 <aigan> Well.. If the object is moving... And its permanent location is USA
13:42:33 <aigan> it should not turn up
13:43:07 <dmiles> ok
13:43:08 <aigan> Hmm...
13:43:24 <aigan> hasBeen is the wrong way to go also... :/
13:43:30 <dmiles> so you want to only query perminantLocation for travel plalnning right?
13:43:51 <aigan> Mostly permanent locations
13:44:02 <aigan> I could go for an easier solution for now
13:44:19 <dmiles> then you will want to (genlInverse perminantLocationOfObject subRegions) since regions do not move much
13:44:43 <aigan> create a subclass of permanentLocationOfObject that genls parts
13:45:09 <dmiles> well (parts ?X Sweden) would make a good query maybe
13:45:42 <dmiles> but  perminantLocationOfObject makes more sense for traveling
13:46:15 <dmiles> well i would say create someththing that ...
13:46:43 <dmiles> (genlPreds permanentLocationOfObject myPermanentLocationOfObject)
13:46:56 <dmiles> query from  myPermanentLocationOfObject
13:46:57 <CycLBot> org.opencyc.api.CycApiException: (S#21632 :MESSAGE "A SYMBOL at 0x40010150 is not a f_6469.")
13:47:11 <aigan> objectFoundInLocation
13:47:12 <aigan> maby
13:47:20 <dmiles> only parent collects child.. child never gets anything from parent l;P
13:48:15 <dmiles> you understand what i just meant with genlPreds?
13:48:50 <dmiles> <aigan> create a subclass of permanentLocationOfObject that genls parts
13:48:52 <dmiles> should be..
13:49:09 <aigan> ... whay would that be better?
13:49:09 <dmiles>  <aigan> create a subclass of permanentLocationOfObject that parts can be the genlPreds of
13:49:17 <dmiles> oops
13:49:28 <dmiles>  <aigan> create a superclass of permanentLocationOfObject that parts can be the genlPreds of
13:50:05 <dmiles> so youurr superclass can lift from its child class  permanentLocationOfObject
13:50:46 <dmiles> youurr superclass can also left from subRegions if you needed it to
13:50:48 <aigan> I could directly change permanentLocationOfObject
13:50:58 <dmiles> ok what would you add?>
13:51:03 <aigan> Why would creating a superclass be any better than directly changing permanentLocationOfObject
13:51:13 <aigan> genls parts
13:51:15 <dmiles> not any better in this case.
13:51:17 <aigan> But that would be wrong
13:51:33 <aigan> how would creating a superclass be better?
13:51:52 <aigan> Gee... Time is up.
13:52:16 <dmiles> right so. then why would (genlInverse perminantLocationOfObject subRegions) not be good or would it?
13:52:38 <dmiles>  (genlInverse perminantLocationOfObject subRegions) is actually true logically
13:52:54 <dmiles> and would make things work for you i beeieve
13:54:17 <aigan> permanentLocation isn't the same as actual location
13:54:34 <aigan> doesn't subRegions talk about actual location?
13:54:37 <dmiles> why cant it use it?
13:54:54 <dmiles> perminantLocation will enforce its argument contraints?
13:55:06 <dmiles> it should
13:55:09 <aigan> Let's say that we know that the actual location is France
13:55:29 <aigan> then we have that the object is located in both Sweden and France
13:55:48 <dmiles> how is that possible?
13:56:19 <aigan> I don't know if that realy would be the effect. But its a contradicion
13:56:40 <dmiles> subRegions your saying would veto or stop such a thing?
13:56:46 <aigan> permanentLocationOfObject doesn't say there the object is
13:57:39 <dmiles> Thing is the contraint
13:57:41 <aigan> i don't know how it works. But if it concludes that the object is located in Sweden it would be an error
13:57:53 <dmiles> but you just said its in Sweden
13:57:56 <aigan> no
13:58:06 <aigan> I said that permanentLocationOfObject is Sweden
13:58:11 <dmiles> ok 
13:58:22 <dmiles> then how could it get to france?
13:58:52 <dmiles> so your saying the object might move?
13:58:53 <aigan> what is permanentLocationOfObject?
13:58:54 <CycLBot> "This predicate relates some instance of #$SpatialThing-Localized with where that object is most commonly or permanently found . ( #$permanentLocationOfObject OBJ PLACE ) , unlike ( #$objectFoundInLocation OBJ PLACE ) does not entail that OBJ is physically in PLACE at any particular time , as OBJ may be taken from its location for use . Attempt to use other predicates , however , for people or organizations . Try its spec-preds #$physical
13:59:05 <aigan> "does not entail that OBJ is physically in PLACE at any particular time"
13:59:23 <aigan> it might move yes
14:00:05 <dmiles> ok then i see
14:00:19 <aigan> thats why I said that maby i should give up and go for objectFoundInLocation instead
14:00:23 <dmiles> permanentLocationOfObject is not applicable to things then or is it?
14:00:42 <dmiles> objectFoundInLocation is better
14:01:01 <aigan>  permanentLocationOfObject is the base class for locations of organizations, hotels, etc
14:01:06 <dmiles> (genlInverse objectFoundInLocation inRegion) is good then?
14:01:28 <aigan> But objectFoundInLocation would not include absolutely all SleepingAccomodations
14:01:59 <dmiles> where would SleepingAccomodations be used with?
14:02:30 <aigan> it would include hotels, camping grounds and maby also boats and houscars
14:02:52 <aigan> ... what is the right word for house-cars?
14:03:02 <dmiles> i would only want to sleep where i knew my bed was objectFoundInLocation to where i was going
14:03:27 <aigan> you would rent the bed and then travel and then sleep
14:03:38 <aigan> thats not the point
14:04:02 <aigan> the point is that a correct model would include this.
14:04:16 <aigan> But I could go with objectFoundInLocation to start with
14:04:24 <aigan> I'll try that
14:04:26 <dmiles> i would yes.. becasue thats a guerntee
14:05:40 <dmiles> (genlInverse objectFoundInLocation inRegion) then still is good ;P
14:08:37 <aigan> (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) didn't work :-/
14:09:13 <dmiles> and thats with the genlInverse set up ?
14:09:23 <aigan> no
14:09:29 <dmiles> it needs to be
14:09:33 <aigan> (#$subRegions #$Sweden ?Y) doesn't work either
14:09:41 <aigan> I'll try with your inverse
14:10:03 <aigan> in BaseKB?
14:10:11 <dmiles> (#$subRegions #$Sweden ?Y) must work though before the inverse will work
14:10:17 <dmiles> yes good place
14:10:45 <aigan>  (#$subRegions #$Sweden ?Y) doesn't give the object
14:10:50 <aigan> only down to Goteborg
14:10:51 <dmiles> why did (#$subRegions #$Sweden ?Y) stop working?
14:11:06 <aigan> It has never worked all the way
14:11:13 <dmiles> it has to have the genlInverse to give the Hotel
14:11:15 <aigan> that was the initial question
14:11:42 <dmiles> ok with your data set way before
14:12:05 <dmiles> it sitll wont work if you used permanentLocationOfObject
14:12:16 <dmiles> i would have to know the gafs you used
14:12:26 <aigan> (objectFoundInLocation Lodging-H424 Goteborg)
14:12:49 <aigan> And (#$subRegions #$Sweden ?Y) gives:
14:12:53 <aigan> [Explain #1] Sweden
14:12:53 <aigan> [Explain #2] VastraGotalandsregionen
14:12:53 <aigan> [Explain #3] Goteborg-Municipality
14:12:53 <aigan> [Explain #4] Goteborg
14:12:55 <dmiles> but the genlInverse didn't work?
14:13:05 <aigan> that's right
14:13:19 <aigan> not for this query anyway
14:13:35 <dmiles> i wonder why.. it should have if you put ion BaseKB
14:13:55 <dmiles> try query in EverthingPSC
14:14:09 <dmiles> err EverythingPSC
14:14:20 <aigan> [Def](genlInverse objectFoundInLocation inRegion)
14:14:29 <dmiles> ok in BaseKB
14:14:43 <aigan> InferencePSC was used
14:14:47 <dmiles> now when you ask use EverythingPSC for your Mt
14:14:49 <aigan> yes. BaseKB
14:15:09 <aigan> no diffrence
14:15:28 <dmiles> increase your Backchains to iunlimited
14:15:40 <aigan> Query halted because : Search space was exhausted.

14:15:43 <dmiles> Depths to unlimited
14:16:04 <aigan> same with infinite Depth
14:16:28 <dmiles> (genlInverse objectFoundInLocation subRegions)
14:16:37 <dmiles> you can always unassert it
14:16:44 <dmiles> in BaseKB
14:17:02 <aigan> Should I add that or edit the previous?
14:17:16 <dmiles> you can edit the previopus
14:17:33 <dmiles> i actually mean subRegions becasue that was transitive.. but typed wrong
14:17:44 <dmiles> err meant
14:18:12 <aigan> must assert in NaiveSpatialVocabularyMt.
14:18:31 <dmiles> ok we'll try that
14:18:43 <aigan> that worked
14:18:51 <aigan> [Explain #1]Sweden [Explain #2]VastraGotalandsregionen [Explain #3]Goteborg-Municipality [Explain #4]Goteborg [Explain #5]Lodging-H424
14:18:53 <dmiles> as long as we are in EverythingPSC should work
14:19:13 <dmiles> yay/1
14:19:17 <aigan> InferencePSC worked
14:19:26 <dmiles> very cool then it's mainly consistant
14:19:39 <aigan> and limited steps
14:20:11 <aigan> let me now try it the other way around
14:20:42 <aigan> (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) doesn't work
14:21:13 <aigan> that means something is still wrong
14:21:25 <dmiles> (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) reduces transitivty
14:21:51 <dmiles> since its supposed to be nearest Locatio
14:21:52 <aigan> ?
14:22:06 <dmiles> butyou can add it to allow
14:22:16 <dmiles> aransitveVia Arg2
14:22:17 <aigan> but Goteborg IS Sweden
14:22:21 <aigan> so it should work
14:23:07 <dmiles> (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) in EverythingPSC ?
14:23:14 <dmiles> does that work?
14:23:22 <aigan> tried that
14:23:42 <dmiles> maybe (genlInverse  subRegions objectFoundInLocation) :)
14:23:46 <dmiles> as well
14:24:07 <dmiles> ask (isa genlInverse ?X)
14:24:08 <CycLBot> ?X = DefaultMonotonicPredicate, ?X = MacroRelation, ?X = RuleMacroPredicate, ?X = PublicConstant, ?X = CoreConstant, ?X = PublicConstant-CommentOK, ?X = CycLReifiableDenotationalTerm, ?X = CycLReifiedDenotationalTerm, ?X = HLReifiedDenotationalTerm, ?X = ELExpression, ?X = CycLClosedDenotationalTerm, ?X = CycLClosedAtomicTerm, ?X = CycLRepresentedTerm, ?X = CycLRepresentedAtomicTerm, ?X = CycLDenotationalTerm, ?X = CycLAtomicTerm, ?X = HL
14:24:45 <dmiles> ask (isa genlInverse SymetricBinaryRelation)
14:24:46 <CycLBot> no answers found
14:24:51 <dmiles> ask (isa genlInverse SymmetricBinaryRelation)
14:24:51 <CycLBot> no answers found
14:25:13 <dmiles> ask (isa genlInverse SymmetricBinaryPredicate)
14:25:14 <CycLBot> no answers found
14:25:18 <dmiles> ok thats why
14:25:32 <dmiles> you need two genlInverse
14:25:44 <aigan> (genlInverse  subRegions objectFoundInLocation) ?
14:25:50 <dmiles> i guess why they call it genInverse instead of predInverse
14:25:53 <dmiles> yes
14:26:33 <dmiles> if genlInverse SymmetricBinaryPredicate then it would not need both
14:26:56 <aigan> maby it shouldn't be. IU don't know
14:27:08 <aigan> But we should submit the changes for inclusion in OpenCyc
14:27:37 <dmiles> the genls* in the nmme im,plies that its a one way transitive on argument 2 in genlsInversere
14:28:00 <aigan> (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) gives:
14:28:06 <aigan> VastraGotalandsregionen
14:28:15 <aigan> ... Hm....
14:28:38 <dmiles> it may be 'nearst' object 
14:28:41 <aigan> that is correct, right?
14:28:46 <dmiles> like not trasnitive
14:28:50 <dmiles> yes
14:28:54 <dmiles> looks right
14:29:01 <dmiles> but thats all it returns?
14:29:43 <aigan> no
14:29:47 <aigan> its wrong
14:29:50 <aigan> wrong wrong wrong
14:29:54 <dmiles> why ?
14:30:03 <aigan>  OBJ is not a part of LOC. 
14:30:13 <dmiles> becasue it doesnt meet the contraints of Object?
14:30:15 <aigan> the obj in location should not be part of locarion
14:30:21 <dmiles> why not?
14:30:37 <aigan> because thats the definition of  objectFoundInLocation
14:30:47 <dmiles> in text.. but not KB content
14:31:01 <aigan> also in content
14:31:30 <dmiles> ?OBJ is anything that can take up matter
14:31:43 <aigan> yes
14:31:43 <dmiles> anything that can be said to be in a location
14:31:52 <aigan> but it should not be part of LOC
14:31:59 <aigan> it should be placed in LOOC
14:32:02 <aigan> not be a part of it
14:32:17 <dmiles> a location can be found in a location
14:32:28 <dmiles> but mayber for what your doing we dont want that
14:32:56 <dmiles> (and (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) (not (isa ?X Region)
14:32:59 <dmiles> (and (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) (not (isa ?X Region))
14:33:13 <aigan> it specificly descibes objectFoundInLocation as diffrent from geographicalSubRegions.
14:34:31 <dmiles> so then..(genlInverse  subRegions objectFoundInLocation)
14:34:34 <dmiles> is wrong 
14:34:41 <dmiles> we instead need a rule
14:34:50 <aigan> right
14:35:38 <aigan> But I should not do this ... I'm still evaluating OpenCyc
14:35:56 <dmiles> (implies (and (subRegions ?X ?Y)(not (isa ?Y Region))) (objectFoundInLocation ?Y ?X))
14:36:18 <dmiles> well cyc is a can of worms ;P
14:36:25 <aigan> And in a few hours it's time to demonstrate how I can do searches with it. :)
14:37:10 <dmiles> its harse we have to always load supplimental assertion on Cyc boot
14:37:38 <dmiles> just so it contains enough to do what we want
14:38:21 <aigan> I'll remove the two previos assertions?
14:38:25 <dmiles> understand its not good for contrained time projects.. but it *is* good that what we create is more easily use3d in the futer of our later projects
14:38:31 <dmiles> more so then any onterh system
14:38:44 <dmiles> you want the first genlInverse
14:38:52 <dmiles> then the second remove
14:39:06 <dmiles> and instyead make a rule... like  (implies (and (subRegions ?X ?Y)(not (isa ?Y Region))) (objectFoundInLocation ?Y ?X))
14:39:06 <aigan> i do..
14:39:09 <aigan> ok..
14:39:15 <dmiles> so you can tie them together correctly
14:39:44 <aigan> and te second was that from subRegions to objectFoundInLocation ?
14:39:52 <dmiles> (not (isa ?Y Region)) is probly something differnt in your case
14:40:21 <aigan> my case? This should be in Cyc core! ;)
14:40:22 <dmiles> or (isa ?X PlaceOfInterest)
14:40:40 <dmiles> i believ eit should go into Cyc's core yes
14:41:09 <aigan> remove [Def](genlInverse subRegions objectFoundInLocation) ?
14:41:12 <dmiles> i think part of 'openCyc' is to benifit from everyones knowledge engineering
14:41:33 <dmiles> coorect
14:42:03 <aigan> and add (implies (and (subRegions ?X ?Y)(not (isa ?Y Region))) (objectFoundInLocation ?Y ?X)) ?
14:42:17 <dmiles> let me look at Region
14:42:22 <aigan> me to
14:42:29 <aigan> GeographicalRegion
14:42:46 <aigan> maby not that
14:42:56 <aigan> negation of what was said
14:43:28 <dmiles> GeographicalRegion?
14:43:36 <dmiles> what is GeographicalRegion?
14:43:47 <dmiles> what is a GeographicalRegion?
14:43:51 <aigan> could we use inRegion?
14:43:56 <aigan> maby not
14:44:04 <dmiles> in Region is not transitive enough
14:44:15 <dmiles> at least i think was why it didnt work
14:44:18 <aigan> mean inRegion for the negation
14:44:47 <dmiles> what is an explew rule your giving?
14:44:50 <aigan> can't go on type
14:45:09 <dmiles> inRegion is not constained to places
14:45:19 <aigan> must go on the negation of the definition of objectFoundInLocation
14:45:42 <aigan> it should not exclude places
14:46:04 <aigan> only exclude things that are parts of ?Y
14:46:13 <aigan> Bof ?X
14:46:16 <aigan> of ?X
14:46:32 <dmiles> parts by the way is very gernel 
14:46:44 <aigan> thats ok
14:47:08 <aigan> because objectFoundInLocation should not imply that its part of location
14:47:22 <aigan> so your first assertion may also be wrong
14:47:27 <dmiles> it does implie #$parts though
14:47:55 <aigan> oups :-/
14:47:59 <aigan> ok
14:48:18 <dmiles> #$parts is the most genral of all things and includes any predicates that have any connectuion to spatiality
14:49:01 <aigan> "spatial part of"
14:49:51 <dmiles> err parts is not just spatuial i guess. but even time
14:50:03 <dmiles> its more the general english term parts 
14:50:39 <dmiles> ok so what do we need to do you think?
14:51:15 <aigan> spatiallyIncludes works not...
14:51:31 <dmiles> i dont think you will find any predicate though
14:51:56 <dmiles> i really think its contraint based
14:52:11 <aigan> what does that mean?
14:52:14 <dmiles> err type contraint ;P
14:52:35 <dmiles> that woyu would want...
14:52:53 <dmiles> (#$objectFoundInLocation Lodge-345 ?X)
14:53:11 <dmiles> ?X=Swenede , ?X= Gotensbuerg
14:53:12 <aigan> (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden)
14:53:29 <dmiles> Lodge-2N2323
14:53:35 <aigan> yes
14:53:36 <dmiles> and that only right?
14:53:56 <dmiles> then you want it to filter out Places that are GeographiclRegions ?
14:53:57 <aigan> yes.  More so than finding the obj in subregions
14:54:46 <aigan> i want to filter out everything that isn't specifically (#$objectFoundInLocation
14:54:53 <dmiles> since you are looking for things that are mostly things only found in GeographicalRegions
14:55:00 <aigan> and...
14:55:57 <dmiles> ok so you want objectFoundInLocation to only be faCTS that are asserted?
14:56:26 <aigan> w8
14:57:37 <aigan> (implies (and (objectFoundInLocation ?X ?Y)(subRegions ?Z ?Y))(objectFoundInLocation ?X ?Z))
14:57:43 <aigan> is that right?
14:58:13 <dmiles> i guess it could be correct .. that works
14:58:36 <dmiles> and is more generic.. good idea
14:58:36 <aigan> I remove the other inverse
14:59:50 <dmiles> was (subRegions Sweden Hotel-N234) not correct?
15:00:48 <dmiles> it may be coorect .. but maybe too tangled for later?
15:01:05 <aigan> I would not call it a subregion...
15:01:08 <dmiles> Hotel-N234 is a Place ;P
15:01:27 <aigan> something is wrong with the implies...
15:01:30 <dmiles> that may contain other places
15:01:51 <aigan> oh
15:01:55 <aigan> just the Mr
15:01:57 <aigan> just the Mt
15:03:10 <dmiles> on the evaluatuion of Cyc.. i was thinking imagine we knew exactly what to do right friom the start... i wonder if then it would be better then other solutions
15:03:11 <aigan> well.. ok.
15:03:54 <dmiles> but its funny .. i have used cyc a while.. and it;''s always trial error for me
15:03:55 <aigan> I try (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X #$Sweden) and get:  Search space was exhausted up to the depth cutoff.
15:04:16 <dmiles> you need at least 1 or two backchains
15:04:25 <aigan> backchains?
15:04:30 <dmiles> becasue it must call that rule
15:04:32 <aigan> what, where, why?
15:04:39 <dmiles> in the Ask window
15:05:01 <aigan> why?!?  That's not logical :-(
15:05:13 <dmiles>  two backchains
15:05:13 <dmiles> [15:10] <aigan> backchains?
15:05:15 <aigan> What is the point if I have to think?
15:05:42 <dmiles> thats why i want to affix backcahin dpeths on predicates a couple days ago
15:05:44 <aigan> I mean... I shouldn't change the query
15:05:50 <aigan> but maby change the assertions
15:05:59 <dmiles> change it to forward and it will work
15:06:14 <dmiles> since it will precahce to not have to backchain
15:06:14 <aigan> change what?
15:06:29 <dmiles> the dirrection of the implies Rule 
15:06:42 <dmiles> right now its a Backwards rule right?
15:06:58 <dmiles> that means it needs a BackChain depth + 1
15:07:11 <dmiles> forward rules do not need a +1 backchain
15:07:24 <aigan> how do I find the rule?
15:07:34 <dmiles> search objectFoundInLocation
15:07:43 <dmiles> then look for rules it appears in
15:07:51 <dmiles> the click the yellow dot
15:08:01 <dmiles> that will let you edit the rule
15:08:17 <dmiles> [Change Dirrection]
15:08:41 <aigan> the dot is purple
15:08:48 <aigan> and there is two identical rules
15:08:50 <dmiles> ok peulpel is right
15:08:55 <dmiles> click that
15:08:59 <aigan> Antecedent Rules and Consequent Rules
15:09:10 <aigan> whats that?
15:09:24 <dmiles> means its use as Antecedant and Consequent
15:09:36 <dmiles> both arg1 and arg2 of implies
15:09:42 <aigan> ah
15:09:52 <aigan> i'll change to forward?
15:09:54 <dmiles> (or #$equiv rules .. as well)
15:09:57 <dmiles> yes
15:10:09 <dmiles> this will also create a cache
15:10:26 <aigan> hmm
15:10:32 <dmiles> but dont worry about that
15:10:38 <dmiles> it self maintains
15:10:48 <aigan> Ok. I don't try to think about it :)
15:11:07 <kinoc> hello
15:11:09 <aigan> But I don't know why I should be forward
15:11:22 <aigan> kinoc: hi
15:11:28 <dmiles> only cuz you want to not have to use backcahining in your query ;P
15:11:56 <aigan> didn't work
15:11:58 <dmiles> they needa more Cycquery-Cognitive
15:12:03 <aigan> even with infinite deapth
15:12:15 <aigan> so I changed to backchain forever
15:12:15 <dmiles> infinate backchains as well?
15:12:22 <dmiles> hrrm
15:12:28 <aigan> and now I wait
15:12:29 <dmiles> ask just the anteceedant part
15:12:30 <CycLBot> org.opencyc.api.CycApiException: (S#21632 :MESSAGE "A SYMBOL at 0x40010150 is not a f_6469.")
15:12:30 <aigan> and wait
15:12:55 <dmiles> (and (subRegions ?X ?Y)(not (isa ?Y Region))
15:12:56 <aigan> I'm waiting
15:13:11 <dmiles> ah well i think backchain of 3 is generally the best
15:13:22 <dmiles> i hope it was contrained to 30 seconds
15:13:29 <kinoc> is there a time limit on backaining ?
15:13:43 <aigan> I'll stop it.. Because it has no 30 seconds limit either
15:13:51 <dmiles> nope there as a Time/BackCahin/MaxAnswers/MaxProofSteps
15:14:12 <dmiles> as far as infernce limits
15:14:44 <kinoc> that is what I mean. The limits are setable ?
15:14:54 <aigan> yes
15:15:09 <aigan> 3 backchain steps. 30 secs limit now
15:15:19 <dmiles> thats pretty safe 
15:15:26 <aigan> ... dmiles: what was it you said before about other things to try?
15:15:43 <dmiles> to query just on  (and (subRegions ?X ?Y)(not (isa ?Y Region)) 
15:15:53 <dmiles> to see if it preoduces the ?X ?Z you really want
15:16:08 <dmiles> oops
15:16:12 <dmiles> not that wrong paiste
15:16:23 <dmiles> (and (objectFoundInLocation ?X ?Y)(subRegions ?Z ?Y))
15:16:41 <aigan> oups
15:16:48 <aigan> no time cutof again
15:17:17 <dmiles> i tried once to create a system for deucing the best 4 contraints
15:17:58 <dmiles> succeswsfully but it needs to have certain predicates and things markings in the KB
15:18:26 <dmiles> it also implimented edge/color/search cache 
15:18:33 <aigan> wow!!
15:18:39 <dmiles> it worked?
15:18:40 <aigan> (#$and 
15:18:40 <aigan>   (#$objectFoundInLocation ?X ?Y) 
15:18:40 <aigan>   (#$subRegions ?Z ?Y))

15:19:15 <dmiles> ok then thats definately the Antedidant you want?
15:19:29 <aigan> Antedidant?
15:19:32 --- join: Yepster_home (yepster@a213-84-17-242.adsl.xs4all.nl) joined #opencyc
15:19:51 <dmiles> the precondition for the consequent
15:20:12 <dmiles> hehe
15:20:24 <dmiles> the consumer to producer 
15:20:38 <dmiles> the 'if' part of a rule
15:20:43 <aigan> ah
15:20:49 <aigan> :)
15:20:55 <dmiles> Ante = Before part
15:21:09 <aigan> how do I stop the forever running query?
15:21:26 <aigan> still forward?
15:21:30 <Yepster_home> bash$ killall latest.bin
15:21:30 <dmiles> well hrrm the broswer should be able to break the socket
15:21:43 <aigan> it has
15:21:45 <aigan> I can work
15:21:48 <dmiles> but Cyc may be too busy to see you are not there
15:21:50 <aigan> but some part is still running
15:22:41 <aigan> but...
15:23:05 <dmiles> that is apain.. i have done that before got cyc so busy it slows my next query down
15:23:07 <aigan> I already have that thing I tried as the if part
15:23:31 <dmiles> ok yes.. so i am think what you needed was 30 seconds at 3 backchians
15:23:36 <dmiles> and that didnt work?
15:23:53 <dmiles> or did you acedently miss the 30 mark?
15:24:01 <aigan> haven't tried with limits. But wihout limits it took longer.
15:24:05 <aigan> Will try with again
15:24:44 <dmiles> well what i would really realy suject is making the rule backwards .. with a depth of 2 at 30 seconds ;P
15:25:03 <dmiles> but you wanted a non bbackchaining solution
15:25:42 <dmiles> "with a depth of 2" with a depth of 2 backchains
15:25:47 <Yepster_home> yes, what's wrong with forward chaining the rules? forward chaining rules!
15:25:58 <dmiles> but i dont know if that would only go 2 deep in the geography 
15:26:24 <aigan> Query halted because : Time cutoff was exceeded.
15:26:24 <CycLBot> org.opencyc.api.CycApiException: (S#21632 :MESSAGE "A SYMBOL at 0x40010150 is not a f_6469.")
15:26:28 <dmiles> i love forward cahining .. but i think aigan might feel the cahce could grow too large
15:27:09 <dmiles> find that rule of yours again.. then see how many dependants it has
15:27:15 <aigan> the rule already is forward
15:27:29 <dmiles> it should have at least 1.. if not chainge its strength to MonoTonic
15:27:35 <Yepster_home> hmm well I think aigan has no choice: waiting 300 seconds for a query in a demonstration is not good
15:27:59 <dmiles> yes forward is good. especially for speed
15:28:04 <Yepster_home> hmm I had something similar today with a forward rule
15:28:31 <Yepster_home> no results.. turned out to be a small error in the rule
15:28:32 <dmiles> i by rule make all my forward rules strenghh monotonic becasue default may be too timid
15:28:57 <aigan> ... I may not demonstrate on computer.
15:29:03 <dmiles> we asked his antededdant to just be sure
15:29:06 <aigan> Maby just show how a Cyc query looks like
15:29:12 <aigan> In contrast to a SQL query
15:30:22 <dmiles> yes Cyc queries are pretty powerfull.. now i just cant wiat till we have a stored priocedure equivalent in SubL
15:30:35 <Yepster_home> it would be nice to have an example that would be easy in cyc and impossible in the db solution
15:30:38 <dmiles> with will be there in 0.7 
15:31:01 <Yepster_home> like performsubl? or expansion?
15:31:26 <dmiles> yeah .. its there its just the 0.6 doesnt have the whole SubL interface
15:31:52 <dmiles> just most of it
15:32:05 <dmiles> err parts of it ;P
15:32:36 <aigan> will the query take forever
15:32:38 <Yepster_home> I actually violated the opencyc license to find out some more subl stuff
15:32:42 <aigan> or eventually give up?
15:32:54 <dmiles> the first one is still running up cpu time?
15:33:13 <aigan> I think i have two now
15:33:14 <Yepster_home> maybe you can write-image, kill it and restart it?
15:33:16 <aigan> still running
15:33:37 <dmiles> yeah you can save your work that way
15:33:44 <aigan> I have the transcript or wht it's named
15:33:53 <dmiles> with ( write-image "mywork.load")
15:33:53 <aigan> Can import from it..  But would rather not
15:34:18 <dmiles> it will load it very fast that way
15:34:23 <aigan> More important now... The time is 00.34 in the night and I mus go home and sleep in 15 minutes
15:34:43 <Yepster_home> good night
15:34:54 <aigan> I hoped to have at least the most simple search workning... :-/
15:35:09 <dmiles> well you have some stuff working
15:35:14 <aigan> dmiles: I have it that way already
15:35:23 <dmiles> and once you have the rule and query right you will be set
15:35:53 <aigan> The hard way is how to explain this...
15:36:45 <aigan> And I still wonder if this is the right time to switch..  Maby continue devolop my own logic DB another year...
15:36:51 <dmiles> btw: you create and imported image.. that might be usefull to post to list.. or url
15:37:30 <aigan> dmiles: but that image is the full KB. Including the OpenCyc stuff
15:37:34 <aigan> It's a large file...
15:37:56 <dmiles> what the .imgage or the geo-database?
15:38:15 <aigan> the "mywork.load"
15:38:41 <aigan> what image was you talking about?
15:38:42 <dmiles> well i meant the text file system you imported (i assumed you created it with perl script)
15:39:09 <aigan> I haven't done anything with that yet
15:39:12 <dmiles> the "mywork.load" is an entire image
15:39:13 <aigan> waiting for 0.7
15:39:23 <dmiles> ah all good.. so you did alot by hand?
15:39:42 <aigan> I have only one city
15:39:48 <dmiles> ah .. ok
15:39:56 <aigan> one accomodation in that city
15:40:02 <dmiles> n/m i thought you translated the geo-content
15:40:02 <aigan> not much for intresting searches
15:40:07 <aigan> not yet
15:40:21 <aigan> I have spent all the time figuring out how to set up everything
15:40:33 <aigan> learning...
15:40:38 <dmiles> :) all good.. so then are you able to load you .load file now?
15:40:45 <aigan> It's not much. I can post it here...
15:41:32 <aigan> I have some things in other Mts.. But this is the main part:

15:44:02 <Yepster_home> we really need cycml export
15:44:27 <Yepster_home> so it will be easier to play around with each others mt's
15:44:48 <aigan> ... Just to figure out how to add ServiceProvider took a lot of looking and thinking...
15:45:04 <dmiles> yes.. it would be nice to (cyc-get-mt "ipdresss" RitTouristGuideGeographyMt)
15:45:42 <aigan> dmiles: But for the real Mt I would of course separate vocabulary and data
15:45:52 <dmiles> aigan: yeah
15:46:09 <Yepster_home> I could write cycml import in oracle if necessary, but the export is what we need
15:46:18 <aigan> And as we have discussed. Maby have the data in a relational DB and have an interface for it
15:46:23 <dmiles> aigan: it least should keep up to data with that Mt organization structure
15:46:38 <dmiles> err up to date
15:46:39 <aigan> But with all the truble today I wonder if that maby is just too hard to try
15:46:49 <Yepster_home> aigan: does rit have an oracle license?
15:46:54 <dmiles> its hard.. and requires many sleepless hours
15:47:25 <aigan> Yepster_home: I'll use PostgreSQL and I find it extremly good
15:47:27 <dmiles> but i thinbk it makes it worth it beacease thik of all the ways for the future you can reuse your current stuff in a later operation
15:47:36 <dmiles> thats what cyc has over conventual DBs 
15:48:16 <aigan> Providing this is done right
15:48:29 <dmiles> Yepster_home: you think oracal can have a listener daemon (like in java) for cyc-remotre-api-call ?
15:48:33 <Yepster_home> aigan: well oracle has an interface to opencyc, postgresql doesn't :-P
15:48:51 <aigan> I should let the experts fix the omission in objectFoundInLocation.  Thats just a bug
15:49:20 <Yepster_home> dmiles: nope. oracle has a listener, but only corba IIOP and sqlnet (and some very old protocols)
15:49:27 <dmiles> so that oracal could take a remote evalation from Cyc and turn it into a table query?
15:49:40 <dmiles> oh so we'd need a proixy interface.. i see
15:50:00 <dmiles> one that could convert the Cyc query to a SQL query
15:50:01 <aigan> Hmm... I could experiment with the free version...  But there will be an interface for other DBs.  So I can wait for that
15:50:10 <aigan> But the main question is if it will be effective
15:50:22 <Yepster_home> yeah, writing a simple server that connects to oracle and listens to a cyc sort of interface isn't difficult
15:50:26 <aigan> And it may be complicated to define the rules in the right way...
15:50:31 <aigan> time to go!
15:50:42 <dmiles> it would be effective if you wrote a couple stored procs that made your access not so combinatoric
15:50:44 * aigan is away: sleeping
15:51:31 <dmiles> hrrm my work wants a visio diagram on how we will use opencyc
15:51:31 <aigan> dmiles: that would take work I would hope an intelligent system would save me from :-(
15:51:48 <Yepster_home> One of my todo lists items after release of 0.7 is to use the 'cyc-remote-eval' thing to call into oracle
15:51:54 <dmiles> aigan: you can write rules that would make it program the stored_procs for you though ;P
15:52:17 <dmiles> and then use them.. appropriately
15:52:56 <dmiles> Yepster_home: definately will speed up situations where we want DB access
15:53:18 <dmiles> probly the first of the access we'll have
15:53:28 <dmiles> thats very cool
15:53:46 <dmiles> i wrote a API clone in prolog that lets us call prolog code
15:54:10 <dmiles> from 'cyc-remote-eval'
15:54:29 <dmiles> also priolog is calling cyc
15:55:07 <Yepster_home> you mean that cyc-remote-eval already works?
15:55:15 <dmiles> nope.. but will in 0.7
15:55:21 <dmiles> so i cant really test it ;(
15:55:34 <Yepster_home> btw, want to do a little thought experiment?
15:55:38 <dmiles> but here is ademo of it
15:55:51 <dmiles> subp: (#$isa ?X Human)
15:56:04 <dmiles> subp: (#$isa ?X #$Person)
15:56:05 <CycLBot> ?X = #$CycAdministrator
15:56:19 <dmiles> subp: (finda ?X (#$isa ?X #$Person) ?L)
15:56:20 <CycLBot> ?X = #$Guest  ?X = ?X , ?L = ?L
15:56:30 <dmiles> oos
15:56:34 <dmiles> subp: (findall ?X (#$isa ?X #$Person) ?L)
15:56:35 <CycLBot> ?X = ?X , ?L = '(#$CycAdministrator #$Guest)
15:56:48 <dmiles> that calls the subp interface
15:56:59 <dmiles> but will call that over 'cyc-remote-eval'
15:57:20 <dmiles> the prolog server accully calls back on Cyc for the (#$ part
15:57:27 <dmiles> the findall is in priolog memory
15:57:32 <Yepster_home> but what does prolog add to opencyc?
15:57:50 <Yepster_home> subl: (#$isa ?X #$Person)
15:57:50 <CycLBot> org.opencyc.api.CycApiException: (S#21632 :MESSAGE "Operator #$isa was not a symbol")
15:58:01 <dmiles> it adds the abilty to maniputate java/ActiveX/reuse 100s of knowledfge tools
15:58:09 <Yepster_home> ask: (#$isa ?X #$Person)
15:58:10 <CycLBot> no answers found
15:58:14 <Yepster_home> doh
15:58:34 <dmiles> also prolog has access to many types of disparate DB system
15:58:36 <Yepster_home> ah, interface to other things
15:58:45 <Yepster_home> I like that
15:58:51 <dmiles> its just geneically a well round Foriegn interface
15:59:08 <dmiles> it also lets you embed arbitrary C code
15:59:30 <dmiles> so for prolog i cvan instance a web unit and download a page
15:59:41 <dmiles> also call shell commands.. and so on
15:59:54 <dmiles> prolog can parse the results back into something Cyc likes
16:00:22 <dmiles> its all socket to socket with Cyc.. so any languyage can do that
16:00:33 <dmiles> but prolog is the one i know best ;P{
16:01:02 <Yepster_home> for me it's oracle i guess
16:01:21 <Yepster_home> though I know I know maybe 20% of it
16:01:23 <dmiles> also the NL parser you saw me struggling wiht priolog on a few weeks ago.. was written in 2 hours in prolog
16:01:44 <Yepster_home> using existing stuff?
16:01:58 <dmiles> i was able to paist some DCG rules found on the web
16:02:12 <dmiles> and make it enumerate its datyastore from Cyc
16:02:31 <dmiles> then i just hooked it up
16:02:38 <Yepster_home> dynamic cultivated grammer?
16:02:42 <dmiles> yes
16:02:49 <dmiles> well from what cyc kknew
16:03:31 <Yepster_home> i've programmed maybe 10 prolog statements in my entire life.
16:03:47 <dmiles> http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/opencyc/swi_interface/english_parser/
16:04:18 <kinoc> dmiles: any word on Eliza in Cyc
16:04:54 <dmiles> i have been working on it.. not much in the last two days though ;P
16:04:57 <Yepster_home> you made that in 2 hours??
16:05:13 <dmiles> i 'think' in prolog.. it's scarey
16:05:33 <kinoc> I used to think in prolog.... back in the 5th gen days
16:05:53 <dmiles> well actually i just had minor workings in 2 hours.. i stull had to work on population
16:06:28 <dmiles> adding things instarted with soundness... work in progress on completenesss
16:06:53 <dmiles> kinoc: prolog is great isn't it?
16:07:15 <kinoc> yes. I made sense when I understood the interperter.
16:07:37 <dmiles> prolog is like ASM with any names you want to use
16:07:45 <kinoc> Do you have a sample eliza pattern in cyc ??
16:08:01 <dmiles> i can make one reall quick.. here is what i am starting from..
16:08:12 <kinoc> I did a prolog interperter once for a mailbot project
16:08:52 <kinoc> I like cyc for being able to go beyond the horn
16:08:54 <dmiles> http://12.225.207.235/offt/sourceforge/logicmoo/opencyc/src/swi_interface/
16:09:08 <dmiles>  opencyc_chatterbot.pl 
16:09:18 <dmiles> oops one sec
16:09:24 <dmiles> i need to reset my Mime type
16:09:42 * dmiles goes and copies the mime file
16:11:31 <kinoc> I am on the alicebot list, which is a 30,000 pattern eliza like bot
16:12:13 <kinoc> All the patterns are in an XML format so you could probably translate some of it into your bot
16:12:27 <Yepster_home> what kind of patterns?
16:12:45 <kinoc> Language response patterns
16:12:46 <dmiles> i'd love to
16:12:54 <Yepster_home> like asking 'you find it hot here' -> 'open window?
16:13:09 <kinoc> yes, stuff like that
16:13:24 <Yepster_home> sounds like schanks explanation patterns
16:13:59 <kinoc> yes, but closer to eliza with a rodney brooks reactive influence
16:14:11 <Yepster_home> dmiles: i solved the 'knows (not knows ?x)' problem btw
16:14:33 <kinoc> It's a quantity attack
16:15:38 <kinoc> the base site is http://www.alicebot.org
16:15:49 <dmiles> http://12.225.207.235/offt/sourceforge/logicmoo/opencyc/src/swi_interface/eliza.txt
16:15:53 <dmiles> ok there is is
16:16:17 <Yepster_home> well to be honest, I don't spend much time on turing tests/chat bot stuff
16:16:28 <dmiles> dictionary will need to become a cyc predicate
16:16:38 <dmiles> err dictionary/3
16:16:49 <Yepster_home> every time i look into it, I am disappointed because of the approach
16:16:53 <dmiles> and e_rules/N
16:17:15 <Yepster_home> 'look for dialog fragments' 'find response'
16:17:27 <kinoc> I think you do need both shallow and deep processing
16:17:33 <dmiles> yes.. chatbots are just a funtime thing to do
16:17:37 <kinoc> Sometimes "hello" is just "hello"
16:18:13 <kinoc> but I do want cyc like logic in the mix
16:18:22 <dmiles> ok.. todo.. add import from AIML .. and from the prolog rules i have now into ElizaMt
16:19:00 <dmiles> the ElizaMt stuff becomes usefull only over a diomain we dont understandf
16:19:22 <Yepster_home> useful for 'presentations'
16:19:27 <dmiles> but yes eliza type scripts can at least help write triggers that start a dialog thats more cognitive
16:19:35 <kinoc> I can also see it useful for NPC's
16:19:48 <kinoc> exactly
16:20:03 <dmiles> i have tunred on CycLBot's chatter interface in #logicmoo
16:20:04 <CycLBot> said you have tunred on cyclbot's chatter interface in #logicmoo?
16:20:11 <kinoc> let me see if I can find where they connected an AIML bot to prolog
16:20:21 <dmiles> aewsome
16:20:55 <Yepster_home> hmm well there nothing more annoying than smalltalk
16:21:01 <dmiles> i can probly just import the dirrived source.. my prolog ker5nel can hold 4 gigs of data :)
16:21:04 <Yepster_home> especially with a stupid bot
16:21:57 <dmiles> well i really want to go for Schank style .. but i think Eliza is a fun bailout
16:22:14 <dmiles> when there is not a script to be identified
16:22:30 <dmiles> or start a Eliza level chat to get things important defined
16:23:01 <dmiles> eliza (AIML) scripts can be used and altered as prolog goes
16:23:11 <Yepster_home> I disagree. It's disappointing when confronted with a simple algorithm. It would be very cool to get a response because of some activated patterns, or a new created one
16:23:14 <dmiles> and if kept in opencyc can be better
16:23:30 <dmiles> It would be very cool to get a response because of some activated patterns, or a new created one
16:23:44 <dmiles> i agree.. and thats what i am after
16:23:47 <Yepster_home> patterns: explanation patterns
16:23:54 <Yepster_home> me too.
16:24:22 <dmiles> elizxa though can serve as a coaching bootstrap though
16:24:38 <dmiles> as in getting the speaker motivated
16:25:19 <Yepster_home> well to me eliza == noise, i want to concentrate on the real problem
16:25:46 <kinoc> AIML + Prolog http://alice.sunlitsurf.com/pipermail/alicebot-style/2001-November/000043.html
16:25:56 <Yepster_home> the first problem is solved: my cyc image currently knows what it doesn't know :)
16:26:11 <dmiles> hey .. very very cool
16:26:24 <dmiles> (too Yepster_home and kinoc)
16:26:32 <Yepster_home> next: make a cycl representation of a explanation pattern
16:26:33 <kinoc> AIML native logic http://alice.sunlitsurf.com/mailman/pipermail/alicebot-style/2001-December/000015.html
16:26:48 <Yepster_home> + some subl and cycl stuff to reason with it
16:27:58 <kinoc> knowing what it does not know is the first step to finding out
16:29:29 <Yepster_home> it can only be answered after a question that was not proven
16:29:53 <Yepster_home> like you also cannot answer what you don't know: the list is infinite
16:30:11 <kinoc> Could it place the offending query on a long term research agenda ?
16:31:00 <Yepster_home> but when I ask you: who are the parents of (some person)
16:31:02 <dmiles> that would be a good idea.. that creates motivation.. /off even life itself
16:31:07 <kinoc> Sort of a low leve idle process
16:31:20 <Yepster_home> then you know that you don't know who the parents of that person are
16:31:53 <Yepster_home> long term agenda: sounds like ashwin ram's 'a theory of questions and questions aksing'
16:32:13 <Yepster_home> (based on explanation patterns :)
16:32:32 <dmiles> absolotuety 
16:32:33 <Yepster_home> really fun to read, it should be available in citeseer
16:33:09 <Yepster_home> http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/ram91theory.html
16:33:55 <kinoc> Sounds about right
16:34:35 <Yepster_home> there is a picture somewhere in which becomes clear that some unsatisfiable questions are stored in memory for later activation
16:34:47 <Yepster_home> 'long term goals'
16:34:54 <kinoc> I have to go back to the shanck model now that we have a script  engine in cyc
16:35:41 <Yepster_home> do you know about swale?
16:36:18 <kinoc> yes, I have 'explanation patterns' but I need a refresh
16:37:08 <Yepster_home> swale is the 'reference implementation' (in lisp) which implements ideas in the first 5 or 6 chapters
16:37:45 <Yepster_home> of which the 6 chapter is the most interesting: combining existing xp's into new ones, to find a new explanation to observed 'stuff'
16:38:18 <Yepster_home> 'stuff' might be behaviour, a story (ashwin ram), or perhaps a query
16:39:39 <kinoc> Could you use cyc to help verify a new explination ?
16:40:21 <Yepster_home> hmm better perhaps: use cyc to formule questions to verify the new explanation
16:40:41 <Yepster_home> like: I don't know a,b or c yet
16:40:47 <kinoc> By finding both positive and negative instances to consider
16:41:17 <kinoc> yes, I could see that
16:43:22 <Yepster_home> in the next few months I have to implement it for my masters project
16:44:05 <kinoc> good luck, seems like a worthy challenge
16:44:16 <dmiles> i am working on the translator now of eliza rules to CycL that i have
16:44:29 <Yepster_home> I am somewhat convinced that for a robot to 'understand' what's happening, a mechanism like xp's is needed
16:44:35 <dmiles> some things use numeric proioiry  though
16:45:00 <Yepster_home> but i find it strange that it isn't implemented earlier
16:45:31 <kinoc> It may be a critical mass thing
16:45:55 <dmiles> thats the part of AI that makes the least sense to me.. my hypothesis is all the good time spent on AI was spent on GAs :(
16:46:09 <Yepster_home> gas?
16:46:12 <kinoc> you need to know a lot to have enough raw materials for your XP's
16:46:21 <dmiles> but should have been spent on implementing these theories that happened before
16:46:56 <Yepster_home> kinoc: yes, but the mechanism can be validated with 10 or 20 xp's
16:47:13 <dmiles> genetic alogrythems and probibilistic bayse networks distracted the good programmers
16:47:56 <Yepster_home> well they are useful for sensors
16:48:09 <kinoc> with GA's you let the computer do the sweating, great for problems you only kinda understand
16:48:19 <dmiles> so over the last 10 years..(good time since our machines could now handle large problems)  were spent on NNs,GAs.. too bad
16:48:39 <kinoc> Eurisko was a rational genetic programmer of sorts
16:48:56 <Yepster_home> well, i did a course in nn's and i liked it, but NN's have it's place
16:49:01 <dmiles> yeah now its time to solve problems we can understand ;P
16:49:31 <kinoc> In the interest of full disclosure check out http://www.daxtron.com
16:50:09 <kinoc> I done both logic programming, GA's, GP's, NN's, vision ......
16:50:44 <kinoc> I have always liked cyc, and am glad I can now get a copy to play with
16:51:02 <kinoc> anyone know about when 0.7 will be out ?
16:51:13 <Yepster_home> a few days ago
16:51:35 <Yepster_home> possible worlds = empty set
16:51:58 <Yepster_home> hmm it's getting late, gotta go
16:52:07 <kinoc> ah, I thought I missed something
16:52:09 <Yepster_home> cya
16:52:16 <dmiles> good seeing you yeb
16:52:22 <kinoc> enjoy, cu
16:53:10 <Yepster_home> (and (released opencyc0.7) (indexicalReferent Today < June 2002)) -> NIL
16:53:16 <Yepster_home> or sth
16:53:50 <kinoc> I guess "real soon now"
16:53:51 --- quit: Yepster_home ()
16:54:31 <kinoc> I guess my view is every method has its place or range of usefulness
16:54:39 --- join: Yepster_home (yepster@a213-84-17-242.adsl.xs4all.nl) joined #opencyc
16:54:59 <Yepster_home> dmiles, you remember we talked about observers?
16:55:08 <dmiles> yes
16:55:33 <Yepster_home> like that cyc can never know what's universally true
16:55:55 <Yepster_home> it only knows what's been observed
16:56:15 <Yepster_home> it's much te same as in section 3.2 of that aswhin ram paper I mentioned earlier
16:56:21 <dmiles> yes.. and Mts are based on obsevation scale or method
16:56:30 <Yepster_home> somehow, all the pieces are there, we just have to put them together
16:57:01 <dmiles> yes.. "we have the technology"
16:57:23 <Yepster_home> ram: 'the understanders memory will always be incomplete'
16:57:29 <dmiles> i think Cyc's kinowledge scale and brokering was a missing peice
16:58:44 <dmiles> but yes the observer/understander is a big problem
16:58:56 <dmiles> and takes allot to solve
16:59:07 <Yepster_home> hmm well i don't see it as a problem
16:59:26 <Yepster_home> in fact, the whole frame problem is an understatement
16:59:28 <dmiles> well i barely see a real problem there.. since rthats all we have solved over time ;P
16:59:35 <dmiles> ok so i retract it's a problem
17:00:00 <Yepster_home> like the yale shooting scenario: is fred (or what is the thing that is shot called?)
17:00:07 <Yepster_home> dead or not after the events?
17:00:48 <Yepster_home> when it is modeled with the observer in mind, the only thing that matters is what is observed
17:01:01 <Yepster_home> hmm this sounds really vague
17:01:56 <Yepster_home> cyc can infer what the observer might infer after the events
17:02:48 <Yepster_home> so the frame problem doesn't exist when the observer is included in the world model
17:02:56 <dmiles> yes.. the knowing/not knowing system is most vital to be able to do on cyc kb.. tio detect incompleteness
17:03:21 <dmiles> to have a general framework for incompleteness
17:04:07 <dmiles> McCarthy one day said that a big problem he saw with cyc is that it could never really think
17:04:28 <Yepster_home> true
17:04:41 <dmiles> i asked him if that was just a lack of KE towards it.. 
17:04:51 <Yepster_home> of think is different than FOL
17:04:52 <dmiles> towards Cyc as an agent thinking
17:05:13 <dmiles> and if someone ever did a Mt based on that.. if it could
17:05:33 <dmiles> he said nothing would really stop that .. hehe
17:05:46 <dmiles> at least trying and getting some results
17:06:08 <dmiles> but in general it could be done.. nothing stops it
17:06:21 <dmiles> you can define a type of thinking in FOL
17:06:37 <Yepster_home> yes
17:06:46 <dmiles> or more of an acting script with infernce over the concept that it has limited knowledge
17:07:07 <Yepster_home> And I think that if you can define common sense rules (as in, write them in NL) it's possible to write them in fol
17:07:30 <Yepster_home> and when you can't define them, it's random thoughts, not thinking
17:07:43 <Yepster_home> hmm that sounds like a contradiction
17:07:51 <Yepster_home> i'm gone now, cya!
17:07:53 <dmiles> yes beacasue thinking is done in language
17:07:58 --- quit: Yepster_home ()
17:08:19 <dmiles>  in this conversation,.. i am proud i have written over 30 lines of usable Prolog code	 
17:08:27 <kinoc> A mental event/image/feeling does not have to be in language
17:08:35 <kinoc> good for you
17:08:36 <dmiles> i almost have the ELiza prolog to CycL done
17:09:12 <dmiles> ok its done
17:09:30 <kinoc> did you check out the AIML pattern format ?
17:10:00 <dmiles> about to add that after this import.. to code that up will be easy
17:10:07 <dmiles> since i have the prolog XML parser
17:10:18 <dmiles> and it will also do web retraival
17:10:31 <kinoc> ah, double pluss good
17:11:01 <dmiles> ok looaded
17:11:13 <dmiles> prolog: sendERulesToCyc
17:11:25 <kinoc> on a cyc/aiml intersection I was wondering about using cyc to manage aiml sets
17:11:37 <kinoc> so the aiml in use would be context sensitive
17:12:15 <kinoc> basically cyc could switch in and out or rewrite the aiml script in use
17:13:14 <kinoc> so a character could change their responses based on the situation
17:13:44 <kinoc> oh, I like your logicmoo stuff
17:14:21 <kinoc> one of those 'long term agneda' projects is a physical robot
17:14:25 <dmiles> yes.. definately modfying runtime is good
17:14:51 <kinoc> you know/remember shakey the sri robot ?
17:15:14 --- quit: person ()
17:15:44 <kinoc> It was one of the first logic driven physical mobile robots
17:16:05 <kinoc> built in the early 70's
17:16:30 <kinoc> We now play games on systems better than the entire university had then
17:16:49 <dmiles> yes.. yet we dont have a modern shakey? :(
17:17:12 <kinoc> it would be nice to build one don't you thin ? :)
17:17:40 <dmiles> absolutely!
17:18:27 <kinoc> so if you have a logicmoo character that can plan, then could we get the plan of action
17:18:39 <kinoc> to go to a task execution system
17:19:05 <kinoc> provided of course you can get proper assertions into cyc
17:20:08 <kinoc> And the taske execution system would have to be real-time reactive
17:20:54 <kinoc> but if you view it as able to accept linguistic commands for immediate execution then it does not matter if the command came from you or cyc
17:21:33 <kinoc> Of course it would have to come up with a cyc understandable enviroment description
17:21:40 <dmiles> yeah the speed  issues i figure will have to live witrh
17:21:57 <dmiles> well currently.. in the Moo the 'look' command is like
17:22:04 <dmiles> look
17:22:16 <dmiles> oops lagged i guess
17:22:24 <dmiles> look here
17:22:47 <dmiles> right a command is just a request for a Cyc #$EVent
17:23:28 <kinoc> If you can trap that event request then you can send it to a remote robot
17:24:11 <kinoc> the only problem is training the robot what to look for (i.e. how to recognize a book)
17:24:45 <kinoc> well not the only problem, but those problems are getting better solutions as time passes
17:25:16 <kinoc> We let cyc do the logic and the robot do the real time stuff
17:26:37 <dmiles> yers by pretty much keeping everthything in Cyc as far as logic we stand a chance
17:26:49 <dmiles> since we can maintain and fix it
17:27:04 <kinoc> exactly
17:27:41 <dmiles> i have a moo.. now that queries cyc every few seconds for the robots next command
17:27:49 <dmiles> but there is no KE to support a result
17:28:13 <dmiles> but the java infrastructurre for the Cammand exiscution and processes exist
17:28:38 <kinoc> ideally, you could swap physical robots and sims
17:28:44 <dmiles> also the bots can execute arbtrary java code
17:28:51 <dmiles> absoloutely
17:28:55 <kinoc> Then cyc can 'dream' before trying something out
17:29:24 <dmiles> yes.. and if that dream requires even a moo physical it has that
17:29:39 <dmiles> the idea of the moo evently will become a dream space for the real robot
17:29:51 <dmiles> right now it has to be both
17:30:02 <kinoc> yes
17:30:18 <dmiles> but it will be nice to step into the robots imagination over telnet
17:30:37 <dmiles> it may exectue at high speeds though :)
17:30:47 <kinoc> now I just need to make a cyc compatible robot/droid
17:31:05 <kinoc> yes, people can dream at up to 50X real-time
17:31:18 <kinoc> when the real-world coupling is gone
17:31:33 <dmiles> i am goiugn thru the prolog system for right now.. and making as much prolog persistance as possible in opencyc
17:31:57 <dmiles> then hopefully these hornish rules can become cycl rul;es
17:32:30 <dmiles> i just need a horn structure in opencyc.. and so far there isn't quite a ussable one
17:32:48 <dmiles> (implies A B) is two horn clauses
17:33:26 <dmiles> A:-B. and ~B:-~A
17:33:37 <kinoc> I havent worked much with full FOL engines, I read about them but cyc is my real first
17:34:21 <dmiles> oops i had it backwards: B:-A. and ~A:-~B
17:34:36 <dmiles> i need something in Cyc that will let me B:-A
17:35:11 <kinoc> sort of a (hornimplies B A) ?
17:35:11 <dmiles> but i know its only a mater of a bug fix or two before i can do that
17:35:17 <dmiles> yeah
17:35:25 <dmiles> they have #$sentenceImplies
17:35:36 <dmiles> which is a horn structure
17:35:45 <dmiles> but its not yet working
17:36:03 <kinoc> maybe in 0.7/1.0 ?
17:36:04 <dmiles> so thats why i am still 1/2 cyc and 1/2 prolog
17:36:11 <dmiles> i beleive by 0.8
17:36:28 <dmiles> 0.7 i think is really too close to release
17:36:45 <kinoc> It will be good to have the fully functional if only empty version
17:36:52 <dmiles> but i heard it will have a planner (WARPLAN) so that can be done in the planner as a hack ;P
17:37:13 <dmiles> but its called SHOP planner not WARPLAN nowadays ;P
17:37:33 <kinoc> mips to burn ?
17:37:58 <dmiles> well i think you haver better scoping with a planner controlled system
17:38:15 <dmiles> its might or might not be worth the mips to use it for that
17:38:50 <dmiles> but still.. i am going to experment with the planner as basic infernce
17:39:27 <kinoc> having the planner would be nice
17:40:00 <kinoc> standard STRIPS model ?
17:40:05 <dmiles> exaclty
17:40:20 <kinoc> good
17:40:32 <dmiles> state-causes-action / state-disables-action / state-implies-state
17:40:52 <dmiles> action-casues-state / action-disables-state
17:41:05 <dmiles> action  = act1 + act2
17:41:20 <dmiles> state = state1 + state2 
17:41:44 <dmiles> rr state-enable-action
17:42:21 <dmiles> rthen the planner invokes quiers to enumerate those possiblities
17:42:26 <dmiles> then makes a plan
17:42:33 <dmiles> of action/action/action
17:42:46 <dmiles> and can probly present a proof tree
17:43:08 <dmiles> i think thats identiacl to strips
17:43:23 <kinoc> very close I have some design and other system projects I wanted to try cyc out on
17:43:55 <kinoc> So you could limit the planner to an Mt that you populate ?
17:44:12 <dmiles> yes.. cyclificaion of past/present/future projects is wionderfull
17:44:16 <dmiles> yes
17:44:43 <dmiles> you can have one plan sspindle Mt and genlMt to whatever
17:45:19 <dmiles> isa PlanningContextMt
17:45:54 <kinoc> So you could load an Mt with raw materials, give it a goal and say 'go'
17:46:20 <dmiles> absolutely how it works.. it will return your list of actions
17:46:33 <dmiles> but the go part you have to do each one
17:46:47 <CycLBot> Cannot find collection PlanningContextMt
17:47:37 <kinoc> Could you also say load an Mt, give it a list of actions, have it simulate the results and look for certain results
17:47:40 <kinoc> ?
17:48:01 <dmiles> yes you can limit its avaible set of actions
17:48:15 <dmiles> and grow that as you go
17:48:45 <dmiles> of i see what your saying
17:48:50 <dmiles> that would be simple to write
17:49:01 <kinoc> Ah, so you could say 'only using actions A,B,C and resources X,Y,Z' achieve goal G
17:49:02 <dmiles> it would require you invoke the plan list
17:49:20 <dmiles> invoke A, invoke B
17:49:20 <CycLBot> You do not have any items
17:49:46 <dmiles> yes that is what you could do in that case
17:50:27 <kinoc> So given a potential external plan you could use Cyc as a simulator/evaluator
17:51:04 <dmiles> absoloutly
17:51:25 <dmiles> but that part requires minor API additions in SubL
17:51:44 <kinoc> which is handy if the system has a complete common sense model
17:53:55 <kinoc> break for 3 min
17:58:19 <kinoc> ok back
17:58:44 <dmiles> still working on cyc_error('"Formula \n  (#$eRule \\', "(CYC-ASSERT '(#$eRule \"sorry\" 75 1 '(?HYP-G5308) 0 \"please do not apologize .\") #$Eli
17:58:58 <dmiles> getting very close tho
17:59:18 <kinoc> cool
17:59:29 <dmiles> have toi create functions to hold BestNLParseFN
17:59:44 <dmiles> but almost there
17:59:56 <dmiles> look at sendERulesToCyc
18:00:01 <kinoc> I had been playing with editing and merging AIML sets
18:00:20 <dmiles> on file: http://12.225.207.235/offt/sourceforge/logicmoo/opencyc/src/swi_interface/eliza.txt
18:00:29 <dmiles> thats the import function
18:01:40 <dmiles> incoding Phrase  now
18:01:58 <dmiles> tyiou see how simple the Prolog to Cyc API is
18:02:11 <dmiles> :-ensureMt('#$ElizaMt').
18:02:17 <dmiles> creates a new Microthery
18:02:51 <kinoc> ah yes
18:03:34 <dmiles> cycAssert/2 cyclifies arbitry prolog terms
18:03:41 <dmiles> if its not an Atom
18:04:08 <dmiles> to call cyc i hook into the undefined function interface
18:04:22 <dmiles> if a prolog term is undefined.. it will call Cyc for help
18:05:03 <dmiles> that sis why:
18:05:24 <dmiles> subp: (findall ?X (#$isa ?X Human) ?L)
18:05:25 <CycLBot> ?X = ?X , ?L = []
18:05:33 <dmiles> subp: (findall ?X (#$isa ?X #$Person) ?L)
18:05:33 <CycLBot> ?X = ?X , ?L = '(#$CycAdministrator #$Guest)
18:05:40 <dmiles> is why that works
18:06:32 <dmiles> subp: (setof ?X (#$isa ?X #$Person) ?L)
18:06:33 <CycLBot> ?X = ?X , ?L = '(#$CycAdministrator #$Guest)
18:06:56 <kinoc> well if ICOT had a cyc like unit to back-end to they would still be in the running
18:07:14 <kinoc> as it is cyc is 'last bot standing' and wins by default
18:08:19 <dmiles> yes exacly :)
18:08:47 <kinoc> do you plan on keeping the prolog system or moving all into cyc, or keeping a hybrid
18:09:12 <dmiles> it handles prioblems like transitive closure,. unification checks, cycly checks
18:09:32 <dmiles> rrr sound unification
18:09:50 <dmiles> i would like to move all Cyc ASP
18:09:57 <kinoc> maybe cyc is the intelligent blackboard all other processes post to
18:10:04 <dmiles> but just releases that hold it back
18:10:26 <dmiles> it definately is
18:10:38 <dmiles> even for each agenbts private varibles
18:10:49 <dmiles> err their runtime instance data
18:11:09 <dmiles> (f thats not too excessive!
18:11:59 <kinoc> depends on the bandwidth/latency etc... my day job is writting routers
18:13:02 <dmiles> well hopping platformish issues can be resolved after all theory is implimented
18:13:33 <dmiles> so bandwidth/latency .. ehem can be fixed by knowledge like yours ;P
18:14:30 <kinoc> I will be glad when the server ports are open
18:27:51 <dmiles> so now i am looking at eliza preds pre AIML
18:28:10 <dmiles> i think i have some etra info..
18:28:58 <dmiles> 	 cycAssert(eRule(string([KeyWord]),KeyWordPrioriy,PrasePriority,PhraseToMatch,Index,string(H)),'#$ElizaMt').
18:29:04 <kinoc> one of the ideas in AIML is that small talk conversation follows a zipf curve
18:29:21 <dmiles> (Index can be removed )
18:29:39 <kinoc> yes, you have extra variables
18:29:57 <dmiles> cycAssert(eRule("Keyword",KeyWordPrioriy,PrasePriority,PhraseToMatch,Response),'#$ElizaMt').
18:30:08 <kinoc> AIML does not have priority, so you could use a default
18:30:34 <dmiles> default now is 50 .. should work
18:30:38 <kinoc> Or set the priority to the number of non "*", and "_" words
18:30:53 <dmiles> PrhrasePriority is if something matches how how to score
18:31:03 <kinoc> In general the more words specified the more specific the pattern
18:31:14 <dmiles> yess.. too much * degrades
18:31:25 <dmiles> more words imporve
18:31:27 <kinoc> Like "what is *" versus "what is the weather in dallas"
18:32:05 <dmiles> socre 10*words - 9* "*"s
18:32:22 <kinoc> seemes a good start
18:33:02 <dmiles> does AIML use keywords?
18:33:11 <dmiles> or is it all phrases?
18:33:23 <kinoc> yes/no
18:33:43 <kinoc> All <category> patterns are phrases
18:34:12 <kinoc> but the interperter builds up a tree to make pattern matching faster
18:34:29 <dmiles> that tree kinda implimetns Keywords
18:34:40 <dmiles> in a odd way huh?
18:34:47 <kinoc> but you can just view the data as sets of patters for now
18:35:03 <kinoc> yes the tree has the effect of keywords
18:35:19 <dmiles> yeah.. i think as long as i can rotate thngs out.
18:35:39 <dmiles> look at this..
18:35:41 <dmiles> CycLBot?
18:35:56 <dmiles> CycLBot?
