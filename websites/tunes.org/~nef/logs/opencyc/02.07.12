04:38:32 <yottzumm> anybody here?
04:39:41 <yottzumm> I'm trying to relate domain specific visual languages to opencyc or cyc, but not quite sure where to start
04:41:03 <yottzumm> specifically, can opencyc maintain the visual language, and the systems created with the visual language, and allow for the visual language to evolve over time, enabling semiautomatic update of the systems when the language changes
04:41:07 --- quit: the-satanist (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))

06:04:06 * zool helloes
07:51:03 <kinoc> ping
07:53:00 <kinoc> dmiles:you only need the std*.aiml set to start with
07:57:46 <yepster> pong
08:18:41 * dmiles returns
08:19:08 * zool lurks quietly
08:19:19 <dmiles> kinoc, ah good yeah it's getting good coverage with std*.aiml
08:20:07 <dmiles> i have uit running on the command line of muy machine.. it picks the best 7 sentenses to respond with.. each sentence uses a scoring probibility
08:20:39 <dmiles> after a response is used once it's score goes down
08:21:20 <dmiles> i think this will relate to other types of information retrieval as far as producing candidate responses
08:27:44 <dmiles> what are you doing ->  [I, am, always, chatting, with, people, on, the, Internet, ., 1.19059]
08:28:12 <dmiles> what are you doing -> li([I, am, waiting, for, my, botmaster, .], 1.53325]
08:29:20 <dmiles> what are you thinking -> [I, am, thinking, about, all, these, conversations, I'm, having, ., 1.67689]
08:29:31 * zool has a friend running running linkparser stuff against the infobot brains now, but the results still look a bit odd
08:29:47 <zool> maybe a problem with the linkparser more than with the humanz
08:30:17 * zool shurgs at people grammar
08:30:49 <dmiles> so the link parser gives a syntactive type parse enough i see to at least know what factiods a person migth be after
08:31:18 <zool> but what we look for is qualititive factoid interrelation
08:31:28 <zool> build up sense of sense about the world
08:31:40 <dmiles> but yeah.. grammer probly has to be completely normalized first
08:31:43 <zool> almost epistemological level, that;s the wrong word though
08:32:10 <zool> is one potential technique, run a few at once, maybe get something deeper out of cross-relation
08:32:34 <zool> relates back to bot behaviours, social conduct almost
08:32:39 <dmiles> well thats what they do.. the epistomologic level at the surface ;P
08:32:45 * zool smiles
08:33:12 <zool> bots modify each other interbot, like humanz :)
08:33:43 * zool wonders about the surface
08:39:13 <dmiles> input->spelling/normalization->surface-syntax-tree->deep-structure->tuples
08:39:39 <kinoc> I know its shallow but you could use the sari idea to normalize some inputs
08:39:59 <dmiles> i guess bots can pick up on anywhere or take two parts of that for an input match
08:40:26 <kinoc> in cyc there is rewriteTemplate
08:40:30 * zool searches for translinguistic deep structures
08:40:53 <dmiles> kinoc, yeah thats kinda what it does in the existing system i add 10% to probibily whenever a srai structure is used as well
08:41:22 <kinoc> is it in any particular Mt
08:42:15 <dmiles> i think a #$rewriteTemplate goes into an TemplateParseingMt
08:42:37 <kinoc> oh I mean your aimls rules
08:42:51 <zool> what is sari in this context
08:42:56 <kinoc> or is it all still on the prolog side
08:43:12 <dmiles> its still all prolog and at the command line;<
08:43:20 <kinoc> It is a simple pattern matching rewrite rule
08:43:34 <zool> right, thx
08:43:41 <dmiles> i am working on the degradation of prevouiusly used responses routines now
08:44:05 * zool has many strategies to learn/play with
08:44:10 <kinoc> so you can map multiple surface forms into one common form for processing
08:44:15 <zool> coo
08:44:23 <kinoc> like 500 forms of greeting
08:45:33 * zool finds lots of junk about silk sari patterns ;)
08:46:16 <kinoc> feeling tropical ??
08:46:34 <kinoc> SRAI -> simple recursive AI
08:46:46 * zool grins, thx
08:50:10 <kinoc> dmiles: i can see how you could view it as a form of IR
08:51:16 <dmiles> IR (in this case)?
08:51:24 <kinoc> info retreival
08:51:41 <kinoc> ever look at answer extraction
08:51:56 <dmiles> yes.. that is how i started to see it.. where the output has a probiblity

08:54:42 <kinoc> dmiles:remember you lego software comment yesterday
08:55:10 <dmiles> yes
08:55:25 <kinoc> http://www.daxtron.com/configuration.htm
08:56:06 <kinoc> just a page on our system construction algorithm using modules
08:56:36 <dmiles> neat EURISKO info as wel
08:57:01 <zool> 'adult robotics'? :)
08:57:07 <zool> bloody hell
08:57:39 <dmiles> zool, hehe, realy though this will be how AI probley first enters the home
08:57:41 <kinoc> learn something new every day :) ah, the internet, a lifetime education tool
08:57:49 --- quit: huthut (Read error: 110 (Connection timed out))
08:58:44 * zool shakes her head
08:59:28 <kinoc> the adult robotics requires a long way to go, not the least of which is a decent brain
08:59:45 <kinoc> oh, and lots of field research
08:59:51 <zool> lol
09:00:04 <kinoc> always looking for domain experts
09:01:01 <zool> isn't human-machine-human, remote-controlled stuff going to work better for those applications then?
09:01:52 <kinoc> if you do a good multi-purpose body then it should support both tele-ops and machine control
09:02:02 * zool boggles
09:02:29 <kinoc> and if you get bored you can set it on auto-pilot
09:03:00 <kinoc> of course if both people  do that, then what does that mean ?
09:03:14 <zool> and this will really help you negotiate life better as a human, get more out of it, put more into it?
09:03:34 * zool laughs at bot sex idea
09:03:53 <kinoc> expand time space options ?
09:04:17 <kinoc> fill irc channels
09:04:18 <zool> it seems not much more than an adolescent boy's fantasy tbh, but what do i know ;)
09:04:42 <kinoc> yes
09:04:49 <zool> a lot of sex is about language and about control
09:04:53 <zool> that is difficult
09:04:57 <kinoc> your statement shows you understand fully
09:05:05 <kinoc> :)
09:05:24 <kinoc> still trying to imagine the ontology
09:05:28 * zool grinz
09:06:02 <kinoc> its amazing what people ask a young bot to do, not even out of the lab no less
09:06:18 <zool> so much of the english casual language has deep roots in sex discourse, body discourse
09:06:27 * zool would like her bots to do other things
09:06:51 * zool laughs
09:07:07 <kinoc> thats why i am interested in a multi-use body , not just a sexbot
09:07:33 <kinoc> when its not catering to adolecent desires it can learn more about the world
09:08:05 <zool> but humans need to do *some* work in order to stay sane and healthy
09:08:23 <zool> and the compulsion flow of creative stuff, how does that fit in
09:08:53 <kinoc> have you ever just got the feeling to get up and do something ?
09:09:09 <zool> most of the time :)
09:09:13 <yepster> did your opencyc copy already asked if it was human?
09:09:28 <yepster> damn that english of me :(
09:09:38 <kinoc> technology does not erase or prevent that
09:09:41 * zool wouldnt be interested if it did
09:09:57 <yepster> it's mentioned in some interviews about cyc
09:10:01 * zool knows that, but wants to see more of a feedback loop, map this work back to the human network
09:10:22 <zool> enhance both
09:10:52 <kinoc> so how does this all merge back into human space
09:10:57 <kinoc> ?
09:11:06 <dmiles> yepster, i would assume it would have open questions not solved by infernce that it could store
09:11:30 <zool> kinoc well, i think about the translation and conversation issues a lot
09:11:52 <yepster> yeah. but that doesn't sound as sexy
09:12:00 <zool> using bots to facilitate and interconnect small-group human conversations about the world, build up bigger pictres 
09:12:00 <zool> :P
09:12:16 <zool> think 'with wearables, we can annotate space, wiki-style'
09:12:31 <zool> map the virtual space the bots live in back onto the allegedly real space we all live in
09:13:00 <zool> deal better with hospital systems, public transport systems, education systems, agricultural systems
09:13:02 <kinoc> with a body a bot can manipulate our space as we do theirs
09:13:45 <zool> i know someone who was working on surgical robot stuff, that did sound really good
09:13:45 <kinoc> i have an idea about the spectrum of intelligence
09:13:54 <zool> tell me about the spectrum of intelligence
09:14:27 <kinoc> yepster does xp stuff ?
09:14:38 <kinoc> explaination patterns ?
09:14:38 <yepster> yeah! explanation patterns
09:15:00 <yepster> still working on opencyc implementation
09:15:11 <kinoc> schank has a passage about the spectrum of empathy in "explination patterns"
09:15:23 <zool> patterns reinforce themselves, stop us changing perspective and seeing better solutions
09:15:35 <zool> right...
09:15:54 <yepster> somewhere in chapter 7 or 8?
09:16:00 <kinoc> where you can simply understand on one end and fully empathize / be one with on the other
09:16:06 <yepster> o no, the beginning
09:16:11 <kinoc> yes
09:16:22 * zool nods
09:16:24 <yepster> : complete empathy -> full understanding of the motives of the other person
09:16:35 <yepster> and on the opposite: no understanding at all
09:16:49 <kinoc> you cant even make sense
09:16:55 <kinoc> of the other
09:17:09 <yepster> very interesting scale, because it also shows humans don't need complete empathy to work together
09:17:33 <kinoc> and his point is that machines can fit in that mix
09:17:35 <zool> how does it show? it just looks like someone's idea
09:17:50 <zool> ideas very like this also exist in plato's republic
09:18:13 <yepster> schank constructed explanation pattern theory on it
09:18:20 <kinoc> yes, its just a modern rendition backed by some software
09:18:25 <zool> i would very much like to see machines facilitate that mix and become part of it
09:18:33 <zool> right, right
09:18:58 <kinoc> no something from left field, chess
09:19:23 * zool prefers to play go
09:19:33 <yepster> also used in xp theory: belief->goal->plan->action
09:19:38 <kinoc> i think it was carl ebling who did Hitech, a chess engine that started the brute forse attack
09:19:53 <yepster> i intend to integrate the plan in that chain with opencyc planner stuff
09:19:57 <zool> 'brute force attack' is such a nasty string of semantics
09:20:08 <yepster> and use XP's to infer goal or belief from another's actions
09:20:10 <zool> the power of words to change the world is immense
09:20:29 <kinoc> in it he came up with an architecture called SUPREM and an interesting plot
09:20:41 <kinoc> of memory vs computation power
09:20:50 <kinoc> for equal performance
09:21:15 <kinoc> human tend to see patterns and have lots of memory but only look a a few options
09:21:39 <kinoc> while a computer lacked pattern matching but could look at billions
09:21:49 <kinoc> to get the same performance
09:21:53 <yepster> xp-patterns <> patterns recognized by e.g. neural nets
09:22:02 <kinoc> yes
09:22:23 <kinoc> so my question is what happens if you combine the two
09:22:41 <yepster> meaning + sensors
09:22:52 <yepster> or better: semantics + sensors
09:23:04 * zool nods, the question everyone wants answers to
09:23:10 <kinoc> you combine the human pattern seeing ability with the computers evaluation skills
09:23:39 <zool> but the answers you get very much depends on how you phrase the question, and certain questions can be dangerous, and certain reassurances can be misleading
09:23:56 <kinoc> yes
09:24:02 <zool> i know this is obvious, i just think the philosophical issues get brushed past with enthusiasm
09:24:35 <kinoc> how you define your problem determine the solutions you find, and they future problems you have to clean up
09:24:36 <yepster> well I would call it practical issues instead of philosophical
09:24:54 * zool nods
09:25:15 <zool> but then the schank-plato thing comes straight out
09:25:21 <kinoc> we may be reaching a point where abstract philosophical issues become pratical ones
09:25:36 <zool> ignoring the thousands years exegesis in between
09:26:04 <zool> igrnoring many other traditions, supplying an answer which isnt contextualised fully, hasnt been read fully
09:26:33 * zool agrees with kinoc, but also wonders
09:26:52 <zool> post-industrialisation hasnt exactly done wonders for our society
09:27:19 <zool> top-down impositions of intelligent peoples' solutions can so easily be distorted
09:27:44 <yepster> example
09:27:46 * zool sorries at being ranty, had longish day
09:28:03 <yepster> I like sewers, for a fact. Or the internet
09:28:12 <kinoc> i have a bottom-up'ist bent myself. massive redundancy
09:28:30 <kinoc> depends on the goals you seek
09:28:52 <zool> i look for a clean example, but can't, because i see layers of historically self-reinforcing patterns
09:29:17 * zool doesnt really have goals, just inclinations
09:29:25 <kinoc> the competition is the environment
09:29:39 <kinoc> so the patterns reinforce
09:29:41 <zool> how do you mean kinoc?
09:30:02 * zool thinks of information monopolies
09:30:37 <kinoc> not a full concept yet, but i am thinking of evolution and game theory
09:30:51 <kinoc> how well an idea survives and propogates
09:31:10 <kinoc> depends on the other ideas and what peoples goals are
09:31:53 <kinoc> if you have an incompatible idea it tends to get squashed or at least no find support
09:32:23 <kinoc> but you need a critical mass of reinforcing ideas to form a viable cluster
09:32:35 * zool likes those keywords
09:32:48 <kinoc> like a new movement 
09:33:07 <kinoc> an idea can emerge at two seperate times or places
09:33:34 <kinoc> but in one case it will die a horrible death, and a hundred years later will be acceted as obvious
09:34:02 <zool> or ripple through everything in variable waveforms; nothing absolutely is or is not
09:34:27 <kinoc> but the interference patterns reinforce ?
09:34:49 <kinoc> destructive / constructive interference
09:35:18 <kinoc> creating nodes of 'more being-ness'?
09:35:36 <zool> that's something i've felt, but only been able to see or express in long streams of words
09:36:04 <zool> but if the nodes are isolated, turn in on selves, suffer from closed system effect
09:36:11 <kinoc> it is a concept that our language is not optomize for
09:36:57 <zool> but many 'aesthetic' activities, arguably all, are a search for that abstract expression
09:37:14 * zool can sense this getting a bit recursive ;)
09:37:53 <kinoc> matter is frozen energy, energy is energy. everything is nothing....
09:38:16 <kinoc> minds and software are patterns of energy
09:38:31 <kinoc> that affect matter.
09:38:33 <zool> do you believe in nothing and everything?
09:38:56 <zool> i believe in tendencies towards one or the other, but not in those kind of absolutes
09:39:16 <kinoc> still agnostic, i dont awant to argue with bullets or atomic physics
09:39:18 <kinoc> :)
09:39:25 * zool grins
09:39:58 <kinoc> but i get what your are getting at, or so i think
09:40:07 * zool thinks so too
09:40:17 <zool> but we'll probably never be able to express that completely
09:40:38 <kinoc> until we can swap patterns
09:40:57 <zool> i spent almost two hours last sunday talking to two people and failing to agree how we could agree that we had agreed about anything
09:41:08 <zool> and that was all we were talking about
09:41:27 <kinoc> but then you need a proper map since no minds are alike, even the same one seperated in time
09:42:06 <zool> the map thing pops up a lot
09:42:40 <kinoc> think about a dog
09:42:51 <zool> can i think about a cat instead?
09:42:57 <kinoc> sure
09:43:22 <kinoc> i see the set of cat that adopted my grandfathers garage
09:43:35 <kinoc> but you may have a more personal experience
09:43:43 <kinoc> maybe you think of big cats
09:44:07 <kinoc> but its a simple three letter word about a concrete object
09:44:10 <zool> i find it hard to engage with non-human things generally tbh
09:44:15 * zool nods
09:44:19 <kinoc> and yet it produces different images
09:44:32 <kinoc> uh oh, luch wagon calls
09:44:44 <kinoc> hold that thought, (or not)
09:44:45 * zool laughs
09:44:58 <kinoc> C U after barbaric animal processes

09:54:07 <zool> we can travel round this S-shaped loop all we like, never meeting

10:56:58 * zool knows the cat story :)
10:57:58 <kinoc> you were about to expound on nodes turning into self-closed islands
10:58:33 <zool> i was just extrapolating a semantic/topological feeling i have

12:43:27 <dmiles> good those nearly always work
12:43:39 <dmiles> is it the query that is not going smoooth or asserts?
12:43:51 <sandos> I guess the release date of 1 July for opencyc 1.0 wont hold =)
12:44:15 <dmiles> that was last year i think
12:44:34 <sandos> isnt the current version 0.6 ?
12:44:39 <dmiles> the goal i think was last june-july ;P
12:44:57 <dmiles> yes its on version 0.6 but 0.7 wont be far ourt
12:45:19 <sandos> ok
12:45:19 <Vutral> no
12:45:25 <dmiles> people kinda thought the end of last month.. but things always take longer
12:45:34 <Vutral> the problem the commands i send to the segment are not getting interpreted
12:45:37 <Vutral> but there is no error
12:45:45 <Vutral> and it doesn't throw exception
12:45:57 <dmiles> on your asserts?
12:46:17 <Vutral> my ask
12:46:27 <Vutral> the asserts worked before
12:46:50 <Vutral> can i do a remote query using cyclbot ?
12:47:30 <dmiles> i have a remote proxy server yes.
12:47:47 <dmiles> when using cyc access you would want to connect to port.. let me get it
12:47:56 <dmiles> (start it up)
12:48:22 <Vutral> hey do you know the chatbot part of the api ?
12:49:00 <dmiles> ok at port 3666
12:49:10 <Vutral> hmm
12:49:25 <dmiles> i am proxying normally what would be on 3601
12:49:36 <Vutral> how does it work
12:49:38 <Vutral> the proxying
12:50:04 <dmiles> its just takes connections from 3666 andf makes cyc think they are from local host to 3601
12:50:16 <Vutral> ic
12:51:02 <dmiles> i did this so i could run certain API from remote machine (like from VB)
12:51:24 <Vutral> ic
12:51:40 <Vutral> what about the chatterbot part of the java api
12:52:01 <dmiles> it is somewhat maintained by Steve
12:52:06 <dmiles> (reed_)
12:52:13 <Vutral> have you checked it =
12:52:14 <Vutral> ?
12:52:17 <Vutral> it looks nice
12:52:20 <Vutral> i think i will use it
12:52:27 <Vutral> or atleast make it usable
12:52:35 <dmiles> yes definately is nice.. it holds conversaional models and everything
12:52:54 <Vutral> it uses a finite state machine model
12:53:22 <Vutral> i found a way how i can make it usable....
12:53:31 <Vutral> but the basic functions are more important atm
12:54:44 <dmiles> yeah.. getting up to having a wrapper system (we alll end up doing that somehow) arround what is there is goodf
12:55:07 <dmiles> like myAppsAssertGef
12:55:10 <Vutral> well if i completed that thing i will make my bot ready here
12:55:59 <sandos> should be awesome
12:56:11 <sandos> :)
12:56:20 <Vutral> hmm
12:56:22 <Vutral> i am a bit bored
12:56:53 --- join: siege (~siege@dsl254-102-094.nyc1.dsl.speakeasy.net) joined #opencyc
12:57:26 <Vutral> wasting money
12:57:35 <sandos> modem?
12:57:36 <CycLBot> Your mode is now set to ''.
12:58:00 <Vutral> Hey Captain, I just created a black ho-÷p!%$û NO CARRIER
12:58:29 * dmiles oppses it use mode to set the default command that things are sent to .. default processor
13:00:10 <Vutral> hehe
13:02:13 <Vutral> hmm
13:02:39 <Vutral> the proxy does not allow modifications or ?
13:03:16 <dmiles> it does
13:03:22 <dmiles> its runs to the trusted API
13:04:08 <dmiles> however i am not sure about something.. some parts of CycAccess may use FASL
13:04:39 <dmiles> Steve, is port 3601 suffecient for CycAccess?
13:05:02 <Vutral> hmm
13:05:04 <Vutral> fasl ?
13:05:13 <Vutral> forte age sex location ?
13:05:22 <dmiles> its a more binary version of how java can talk to OpenCyc
13:05:29 <Vutral> i use binary
13:05:36 <Vutral> hehe
13:06:05 <Vutral> i fixed the problem
13:06:07 <Vutral> it works now
13:06:09 <Vutral> perfectly
13:06:26 <dmiles> what was it?
13:06:39 <Vutral> my fault
13:06:39 <dmiles> non prefixing constants with #$ ?
13:06:48 <Vutral> i compared a string with a non string object
13:06:53 <Vutral> but java did not bark
13:06:56 <Vutral> that is funny
13:07:08 <dmiles> equals() will compare any two things
13:07:08 <sandos> with == ?
13:07:14 <sandos> yeah exactly
13:07:14 <Vutral> you see
13:07:23 <Vutral> not ==
13:07:26 <Vutral> == only for numbers
13:07:36 <dmiles> == for objrefs
13:07:43 <Vutral> :/
13:07:53 <sandos> equals probably take a Object ref, right?
13:08:06 <sandos> since its in Object :)
13:08:24 <dmiles> yeah equals() is object overloadable
13:08:27 <Vutral> hmm hmm
13:08:31 <Vutral> scks
13:08:32 <Vutral> sucks
13:08:38 <sandos> java is nice
13:08:46 <Vutral> shutup :>
13:08:49 <Vutral> equals annoys
13:08:49 <dmiles> Object.equals() defaults tio ==
13:08:51 <sandos> :)
13:08:54 <Vutral> compare is 
13:10:11 <dmiles> the CycObjects (and subclases) can be made at differnt times.. they .quals() based on what they represent iover their refernces
13:10:12 <Vutral> well
13:10:15 <Vutral> i am happy again
13:10:22 <siege> == compares the equality of any native type... of which references are a member :)
13:10:28 <Vutral> well see
13:10:43 <Vutral> comparing strings with == fails
13:10:47 <Vutral> most of the time
13:10:48 <sandos> yup
13:10:54 <siege> unless it's a reference to the same String
13:10:59 <Vutral> yeah
13:11:00 <Vutral> but equals works
13:11:06 <Vutral> so equals is the choice :>
13:11:06 <siege> that is correct.
13:11:07 <sandos> yes
13:15:41 <kinoc> anyone know the magick cyc port proxy incantation? want to get a start on using tools on 'that other OS' :)

14:03:10 * dmiles returns
14:07:31 <dmiles> kinoc, the proxy is just replicationg the same TCP calls.. basicly VB calls normal API commands and then reads a response code then a response argument.. when VB is done it sends an (api-quit)
14:08:30 <dmiles> with 0.7 a proxy will not be nesissary becasue the security model will enable it to be done dirreclt
14:09:42 <dmiles> Vutral, are you creatinga  CycAccess that connects the the Bots address instead?
14:09:59 <Vutral> ?
14:10:00 <dmiles> if you do that.. then it would show up on the bot
14:10:05 <Vutral> how you mean
14:10:44 <Vutral> a CycAccess which obtains the address of the bot and then connects to it ?
14:10:44 <dmiles> that CycLBot goes to my local cyc server.. when you asked about Pi i was figuing you sent commands at it already
14:11:04 <Vutral> i do ?
14:11:06 <dmiles> CycAccess can point to any Server or IP
14:11:14 <Vutral> i don't think so
14:11:15 <Vutral> sorry
14:11:19 <dmiles> err IP and Port
14:11:46 <dmiles> well its all good.. i was wondering why you'd think CycLBot might know your Pi asserttions
14:11:53 <dmiles> ask (isa Pi ?W)
14:11:53 <CycLBot> ?W = Individual, ?W = PartiallyIntangibleIndividual, ?W = IntangibleIndividual, ?W = Thing, ?W = PartiallyIntangible, ?W = Intangible, ?W = MathematicalOrComputationalThing, ?W = MathematicalThing, ?W = MathematicalObject, ?W = Number-General
14:12:01 <dmiles> ah it remmbers from yesterday
14:14:10 <dmiles> kinoc, so the proxy is just a java app.. it can be done from ipchains as well
14:14:44 <dmiles> i just never learned how to make packets source address look like they have changed
14:14:56 <dmiles> so i just did http://12.225.207.235/offt/sourceforge/logicmoo/src/logicmoo/net/TelnetProxyServer.java
14:15:38 <Vutral> it does not
14:15:42 <Vutral> you asserted that
14:15:50 <Vutral> i was thinking about some automatically search
14:15:55 <dmiles> yesterday .. yeah
14:15:56 <Vutral> if your cycl does not find it directly
14:16:01 <Vutral> it searches at other peers
14:16:07 <Vutral> pre yesterday
14:16:09 <dmiles> you meran go outside of Cyc?
14:16:25 <dmiles> there are/will be ways i bet 
14:16:37 <dmiles> maybe Cyc to Cyc
14:17:25 <dmiles> or a sharing system.. with cyc-api-remote-eval it can be done.. maybe though there are more dirrect ways cyccorp works on
14:17:50 <dmiles> part of witch could use some coAbs / soap / cycml system
14:18:38 <Vutral> dmiles
14:18:40 <Vutral> gratulate me
14:18:40 <dmiles> but in interim cases you should be able to soon use cyc-api-remote-eval to make cyc call your processes to get info
14:18:45 <Vutral> i am a jump forward in my work
14:19:10 <dmiles> yes you quickly grasped and started ussing cyc.. ciongrats
14:19:34 <dmiles> Congrats!
14:20:23 <Vutral> hmm
14:20:23 <Vutral> ok
14:20:27 <Vutral> in a jiffy
14:20:37 <Vutral> i have a 100times bigger potential
14:20:46 <Vutral> the information flow incresed also
14:21:24 <kinoc> i C
14:21:50 <kinoc> do you think ipchains would work
14:22:09 <Vutral> for what
14:22:19 <Vutral> iptables is state of the art
14:22:33 <dmiles> Vutral, when we want to run windows application to use cyc on ourr linux machines
14:22:53 <dmiles> yeah .. i complied my 7.3 kernal to use ipchains as well ..
14:22:58 <Vutral> ok
14:22:59 <Vutral> well
14:23:02 <Vutral> it works
14:23:09 <Vutral> ipfwdadm or so
14:23:13 <Vutral> i cannot remember exactly
14:23:25 <Vutral> it's a way of forwarding connections
14:23:29 <Vutral> or rinetd
14:23:37 <Vutral> it's a application level solution
14:23:46 <Vutral> rinetd works for sure for redirecting to localhost
14:23:55 <Vutral> and you have access control
14:24:05 <Vutral> you can do it over ipchains also
14:24:06 <Vutral> but...
14:24:09 <Vutral> :>
14:25:05 <kinoc> well lets see what i can break
14:25:10 <Vutral> hmm
14:25:10 <Vutral> ok
14:32:23 <Vutral> dmiles ?
14:32:29 * dmiles listens
14:32:32 <Vutral> what are you doing actually ?
14:33:02 <dmiles> ?- alice('what is it').
14:33:02 <dmiles> 0.936 ["it", being, get([it]), ?]
14:33:02 <dmiles> 0.971018 [srai([WHAT, IS, IT])]
14:33:02 <dmiles> 0.71 [think(set(it, [set(topic, [[WHAT, IS, IT]])])), srai([CATCHALL])]
14:33:16 <dmiles> working on improving the ALice in prolog atm
14:33:24 <Vutral> ic
14:33:30 <Vutral> cool
14:33:43 <dmiles> so then i will have a figthing chance doing it in lisp/subl
14:34:20 <dmiles> the get/set api can be dirrected to the user's mt
14:34:28 <dmiles> and use cyc queries
14:35:21 <Vutral> sounds nice
14:35:27 <Vutral> what about working on the mud a bit later ?
14:37:56 <dmiles> yes.. siege just sent me a telnet handler that cleans things up.
14:38:34 <dmiles> siege, whats the stus of aplpha 6 right now?
14:38:41 <dmiles> (err 7?)
14:49:40 <Vutral> hmm
14:49:43 <Vutral> too silent here
14:50:46 <dmiles> more active then #ai ;P
14:51:08 <Vutral> yeah
14:53:59 <Vutral> i am bored
14:55:04 <dmiles> why dont you write a perl to cyc 1 to 1 binding?
14:55:27 <devEiant> Yeah, do. Then I'll port that to Ruby.
14:55:30 <dmiles> or tcl ;P .. it would be great if in opencyc cvs.. we had a module tree for each programming language ;P
14:55:52 <dmiles> devEiant: that would be super cool
14:56:39 <Vutral> hmmm
14:56:54 <Vutral> well i have access to it yet :P
14:56:58 <Vutral> but it is not portable
14:57:09 <Vutral> i can use it from all languages
14:57:10 <dmiles> yepster created one for Oracle and I did one for SWI-Prolog, greymalson did one for scheme
14:57:15 <siege> dmiles: working on getting logins working
14:57:34 <siege> working on a MudPath.reverse method
14:57:51 <siege> thinking out how i/o should work (thanks TechnoBuddha)
14:57:59 <devEiant> Does it have a C API? Or just Java?
14:58:11 <siege> "just" java :)
14:58:20 <dmiles> just a java API.. which wraps the socket API
14:58:21 <siege> but I could JNI it to something C
14:58:30 <siege> if necessary... hm
14:58:45 <siege> be interesting to do an IO plugin in C
14:58:49 <siege> hmph.
14:58:59 <devEiant> Sorry. Didn't mean to let my bias show. =:)
14:59:09 <siege> no worries
14:59:28 <siege> just consider me jealous: I don't know C well enough to write networking code.
14:59:54 <dmiles> yeah a C library would be nice.. i wonder if JNI is the best way.. partly it's good because steve keeps the java classes up to date wuith the internal Socket API.. if a change happens in the Socket API .. java is the first one to find out
15:00:01 <siege> dmiles: there are a couple of small bugs in that TelnetConsole that I'm fixing... I'll send you a new copy tomorrow morning.
15:00:11 <TechnoBuddha> my pleasure sir :).. glad to help all i can.
15:00:34 <siege> good ideas make for projects worth writing :)
15:01:11 <dmiles> cool siege
15:01:26 <siege> it's funny... I actually started writing that console as a login shell for the mud, but then I wanted an immediate application, so I converted it for beanshell
15:01:42 <siege> I sent pat (beanshell author) a copy asking if it would be any use for him...
15:01:56 <siege> it'd be funny if I ended up having code in the beanshell tree...
15:02:18 <dmiles> yeah.. well it does work nicely as a generic telnet into java beanshell
15:02:40 <dmiles> then has a command override that could send it along to some other callback app.. like a mud
15:03:01 <siege> actually, I wrote some "fake" mud commands in bsh
15:03:11 <siege> look, go, the core directions
15:03:16 <Vutral> dmiles: hey
15:03:17 <devEiant> Anyone have a pointer to the SubL Reference? Link from Opencyc.org appears to be broken.
15:03:18 <Vutral> how is it
15:03:24 <siege> createExit, createLink
15:03:50 * siege is talking too much mud on the opencyc channel
15:03:58 <dmiles> http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/ref/subl-reference.html
15:04:25 <devEiant> Thanks.
15:04:50 <dmiles> siege, not at all .. Johnd mentioned having more interest in IRC channel would not be bad.. many 1000s of downloads of opencyc
15:05:31 <Vutral> fuck fuck fuck
15:05:42 <dmiles> even if the talk is what we are working on.. it still relates to OpenCyc in many ways
15:06:10 <dmiles> so i see.. does that mean beanshell has a default 'this' that you set?
15:06:15 <dmiles> with the command members?
15:07:06 <dmiles> or did you try toi run it bsh.. then if that fails you append with defualt opject like mud.<text> ?
15:09:14 <siege> well, right now it doesn't actually use the mud command interpreter
15:09:34 <siege> I replaced the cd() command to use the mudRoot instead of files
15:09:45 <siege> added an ls() command
15:09:47 <dmiles> :P hehe
15:09:59 <dmiles> ls() = look ?
15:10:08 <siege> nah, look() is look ;)
15:10:16 <siege> I'll send you that script, if you want
15:10:26 <siege> see, they're all soft-defined in a loaded script
15:10:28 <dmiles> ls() is so we can look exactly what objects are found in location?
15:10:33 <siege> nothing hard-coded
15:10:37 <siege> right
15:10:52 <siege> ls() gives a list of contents and a list of named sections and what's in them
15:11:02 <siege> cd lets you change into them
15:11:25 <siege> when you cd, it sets the variable "n" to the current mud object you're "in"
15:11:33 <Vutral> intresting
15:11:47 <Vutral> i would add the capability for remote rooms
15:11:50 <siege> the "move" commands just look for an exit with that name, get the mudpath associated with the exit, and cd to it
15:12:35 <siege> you can do like MudObject other = MudPath.resolvePath(null, "/midgaard/border-wall/west-gate");
15:13:02 <siege> and other will be set to the mud object named "west-gate" inside the border-wall ...
15:13:14 <Vutral> siege
15:13:17 <siege> yo
15:13:18 <Vutral> remote objects and rooms
15:13:24 <Vutral> a distributed mud
15:13:34 <siege> oh, THAT kind of remote object
15:13:48 <siege> working on the theory of it
15:13:51 <siege> using RMI
15:14:07 <siege> should work well.
15:14:13 <Vutral> hmm
15:14:22 <Vutral> not very portable
15:14:31 <Vutral> i thought about a protocol
15:14:32 <TechnoBuddha> i think that a distributed mud works best when you use the "portal" concept, so you can cleanly jump from one to another.. too much intercommunication can be troublesome, and also, if one goes down, it could have a large impact on another.
15:14:44 <Vutral> well
15:14:51 <Vutral> the mud can cache the data of the other one
15:14:52 <siege> there are SO MANY protocols for intra-mud communications, a lot of them are even less portable
15:14:57 <siege> I don't want to write yet another one.
15:15:14 <Vutral> siege: just one which does not require java
15:15:24 <Vutral> or implement a intra-mud protocol which exists
15:15:25 <siege> XML-RPC ?
15:15:40 <TechnoBuddha> as long as it is low volume, xml-rpc shouldn't be much worse than rmi.
15:15:51 <Vutral> well
15:15:53 <TechnoBuddha> rmi blows for large volume anyway.
15:15:54 <Vutral> xml-rpc is ok
15:15:57 <Vutral> but performance is low
15:15:57 <siege> hm
15:16:02 <siege> XML-RPC is easier, too
15:16:05 <Vutral> ascii-network is better
15:16:12 <Vutral> tcp is reliable
15:16:15 <Vutral> rdp is too
15:16:20 <Vutral> udp is not so
15:16:27 <siege> XML-RPC is over tcp
15:16:29 <Vutral> but you can always use binary
15:16:30 <TechnoBuddha> xml-rpc is tcp based
15:16:34 <Vutral> nope
15:16:40 <siege> uh... yes
15:16:41 <Vutral> xml-rpc is a protocol definition
15:16:48 <Vutral> not a transport way
15:16:57 <Vutral> xml-rpc works over smtp also / uucp 
15:17:00 <TechnoBuddha> usually it is implemented, on the server side, over tcp.. i have never seen a udp based xml-rpc service.
15:17:03 <Vutral> and much more
15:17:05 <Vutral> than tcp
15:17:10 <siege> hm, true. I should say that it's available over tcp
15:17:12 <Vutral> it's just a way to pack the informations
15:17:31 <Vutral> usual you use http today
15:17:56 <Vutral> i prefer reimplementation of one of these existant intra-mud protocols
15:17:58 <Vutral> a good one
15:18:16 <siege> those that I have seen are all specific to their "type" of mud
15:18:16 <Vutral> imagine you can extend it if needed and parallel you still have rmi available
15:18:24 <siege> and not nearly extensible
15:18:32 <Vutral> i think there is a RFC
15:18:36 <Vutral> even
15:19:23 <siege> got a link?
15:21:14 <Vutral> i dunno the number
15:21:17 <Vutral> i just read about one
15:21:19 <Vutral> or i read it
15:21:24 <Vutral> i read much rfcs
15:21:26 <siege> ... what it was called?
15:21:26 <Vutral> ietf.org
15:21:32 <Vutral> i dunno
15:21:43 <siege> yes, that's where I've been getting all these telnet extensions from
15:23:30 <Vutral> if not
15:23:36 <Vutral> i can develop a protocol for you
15:23:45 <Vutral> textual one prefered
15:23:48 <Vutral> nicely documented
15:24:05 <Vutral> portable
15:24:22 <Vutral> rmi is still ok
15:24:35 <Vutral> but you need to tell me more then
15:24:45 <Vutral> and the objects... if they change too often
15:25:00 <Vutral> that is the effort of non rmi......
15:25:12 <Vutral> change in objects does not cause incompatiblity
15:25:28 <siege> you know what would make my week? if the beanshell guy emailed me back, interested in the TelnetConsole, and wanted to use it (or the fixed version) as a part of bsh.
15:25:31 <Vutral> and a good made protocol can run in multiple versions parallel backward-compatible
15:25:39 <Vutral> :>
15:25:44 <Vutral> ic
15:25:59 <siege> luckily, MudObject is XMLEnabled... and can be represented as an org.w3c.dom.Element
15:26:38 <Vutral> it runs under 1.3 ?
15:26:40 <Vutral> 1.3.1
15:26:48 <Vutral> or 1.4 non backward compat
15:27:42 <siege> what does?
15:27:55 <siege> the mud as a whole? 1.4 (I use java.util.logging)
15:28:08 <Vutral> i don'T
15:28:10 <Vutral> i got 1.3.1
15:28:15 <Vutral> and 1.4 is not ported yet
15:28:21 <siege> to what?
15:28:29 <Vutral> log4j is backward compatible
15:28:30 <CycLBot> logging is set false
15:28:37 <Vutral> log
15:28:37 <CycLBot> logging is set false
15:28:39 <Vutral> log true
15:28:40 <CycLBot> logging is set true
15:28:42 <Vutral> lol
15:28:52 <Vutral> log 20
15:28:52 <CycLBot> logging is set false
15:28:57 <Vutral> that is wrong
15:29:02 <sandos> =)
15:29:05 <Vutral> the logarithm of 20 is not logging is set false
15:29:13 <sandos> ;)
15:29:23 <Vutral> hmm
15:29:25 <Vutral> log
15:29:25 <CycLBot> logging is set false
15:29:27 <Vutral> log true
15:29:27 <CycLBot> logging is set true
15:29:28 <Vutral> log
15:29:29 <CycLBot> logging is set false
15:29:33 <Vutral> boaaaah
15:30:20 <Vutral> siege: well
15:30:47 <siege> ?
15:31:13 <Vutral> rmi..
15:32:39 <Vutral> where is the source ?
15:32:43 <Vutral> of MudObject
15:33:13 <siege> on my hard drive :)
15:34:22 <Vutral> come on
15:34:25 <siege> I am not prepared to give out any source for alpha6 yet.
15:34:28 <Vutral> let me check it out
15:34:33 <Vutral> i want to work on it yet
15:34:34 <siege> it'll be in CVS sometime
15:34:55 <siege> there's some javadoc avail on the site
15:35:18 <Vutral> btw
15:35:28 <Vutral> how do you manage it if the location of the object changes
15:35:35 <Vutral> let me guess
15:35:38 <Vutral> you don't....
15:35:40 <Vutral> hehehe
15:35:50 <siege> location of what object?
15:35:55 <Vutral> address
15:35:57 <siege> objects change location all the time
15:36:04 <Vutral> ip
15:36:06 <Vutral> host
15:36:26 <siege> this will be a plugin. probably affected similarly to the way NFS mounts work...
15:36:42 <siege> the plugin will point to a machine and a resource, and will define a mount point
15:36:56 <siege> when initialized, that mountpoint will translate to locations on the remote machine
15:37:17 <siege> if the location of the machine changes, then you just tell the plugin to look elsewhere and termintate();initialize(); it
15:37:23 <Vutral> well the mountpoint changes
15:37:35 <Vutral> lol
15:37:45 <Vutral> but you don't notice when it happens
15:37:47 <siege> the primary mount point should not change, no
15:37:57 <Vutral> you will earliest notice when the mount point knocks on your door
15:38:00 <Vutral> but it does not
15:38:02 <siege> remote objects, I'm thinking, will not save locally
15:38:04 <Vutral> cause it's rmi
15:38:15 <Vutral> problematic
15:38:16 <siege> this'll save some headaches
15:38:22 <Vutral> and cause
15:38:28 <Vutral> if the peer disappears
15:38:34 <Vutral> the object is gone
15:38:42 <Vutral> the room is gone
15:38:43 <siege> then those in the peer are left with stubs
15:38:47 <Vutral> the player is in nothing
15:38:57 <Vutral> a cache
15:39:00 <siege> yup
15:39:01 <Vutral> or wut
15:39:08 <Vutral> hmm
15:39:22 <siege> just not a very large one
15:39:24 <Vutral> i will cause you headache enough i think :>
15:39:32 <Vutral> when i try to rmi
15:39:46 <siege> you're be very helpfull, thank you.
15:40:11 <Vutral> lol
15:40:16 <Vutral> hmmm
15:40:17 <Vutral> imagine this
15:40:20 <Vutral> there is no object 
15:40:23 <Vutral> only xml data
15:42:37 <Vutral> does MudObject extend RemoteObject ?
15:45:49 <Vutral> rmi is the reason why i don't use it
15:45:50 <Vutral> lol

18:44:30 <Vutral> dmiles
18:44:32 <Vutral> cool
18:44:37 <Vutral> how good are you in c ?
18:44:44 <dmiles> i am writting in C now
18:44:50 <Vutral> hey i got an function
18:44:59 <Vutral> and i would like if you could help me fixing it
18:45:16 <dmiles> sure as long as you work from an httpd mapped filesystem
18:45:32 <Vutral> i don't
18:45:39 <Vutral> but it's not much
18:45:42 <Vutral> it's a splitter
18:45:59 <dmiles> oh string splitter
18:46:04 <Vutral> i split a char * into (int)count pieces
18:46:14 <dmiles> hrrm i only know enough to be troublesome
18:46:29 <Vutral> if the count is reached i need to put the remaining tokens (i use strtok) into the last array char 
18:46:34 <Vutral> char pointer 
18:46:41 <Vutral> lol :>
18:48:03 <dmiles> last array char.. you mean the chars at the last address?
18:49:55 <Vutral> yeah
18:50:00 <Vutral> i have a array of char pointers
18:50:09 <Vutral> char *bla[]
18:50:13 <Vutral> like argv
18:50:15 <Vutral> :>
18:50:31 <Vutral> the elements of that are my result later
18:50:48 <dmiles> sounds like when you get to the end you are placing what yoiu havent already sucked up?
18:51:21 <Vutral> yeah
18:51:26 <Vutral> let me paste you some code
18:51:36 <dmiles> how do you shrink your stringtok produced array?
18:52:24 <dmiles> sounds like you need to make anew array.. then length of your tail and put things over to that
18:52:44 <dmiles> strcpy each of the tail end 
18:53:30 <Vutral> i have a array
18:54:06 <dmiles> souds like it going to look like [e1,e2,e3,[e4,e5,...]]
18:54:09 <dmiles> right ?
18:54:13 <Vutral> nope
18:54:32 <Vutral> e[0] till e[count]
18:54:41 <dmiles> [e1,e2,e3,"e4 e5 e6"] ?
18:54:44 <Vutral> every element of e is a char pointer
18:54:51 <Vutral> yeah
18:54:59 <Vutral> if count is reached
18:55:05 <Vutral> let's assume its 4
18:55:15 <Vutral> but there are 6 tokens
18:55:21 <Vutral> it looks like in the example
18:55:23 <Vutral> you gave
18:55:33 <Vutral> 03:58:00
18:56:25 <dmiles> hrm ok i see what you are doing.. you need to create the last string and start appeneing your tokens
18:57:12 <dmiles> printbuf() yeah
18:57:21 <Vutral> hehe
18:57:25 <Vutral> i do that for debug
18:57:48 <Vutral> the problem is basically
18:57:50 <Vutral> the first
18:57:53 <Vutral> element of all
18:58:04 <dmiles> oh string append i see.. well sounds like you are not malocing enough 
18:58:04 <Vutral> gets set out of the for loop
18:58:31 <Vutral> i append as much as the string i split is
18:58:34 <Vutral> that should be more than enough
18:58:40 <dmiles> or maybe you mallac on the langhth of original?
18:58:46 <Vutral> yes
18:58:48 <dmiles> yeah
18:58:55 <Vutral>  if(i == times-1) {
18:58:59 <Vutral>    out[times-1] = (unsigned char *)malloc(strlen(str)+1);           
18:59:02 <Vutral>    }      
18:59:04 <Vutral> there
18:59:14 <Vutral> the last element
18:59:14 <dmiles> ok then in that case what is wrong?

19:01:06 <dmiles> awesome!
19:01:40 <Vutral> well
19:01:42 <Vutral> the last tokens
19:01:45 <Vutral> are not getting appended
19:01:47 <Vutral> i dunno why

19:22:25 <dmiles> it allows prolog to make java objects and threads.. everyone on the SWI_prolog lists complains they get called by java but never the respect of calling java themselves
19:22:53 <graylensman> Now read display loop is on a separate thread.  +5 lines of code but refactored -3.  Now 33 lines total.
19:23:00 <dmiles> so in the Cyc to SWI-Prolog calling bindings maybe i can have it do it over prolog code
19:23:24 <dmiles> but i am sure someone would rtahter just call java dirrectly from cyc

20:10:33 <dmiles> not mush charicter handling?
20:10:57 <graylensman> No I am using REGEXP to parse all the read lines.
20:11:38 <graylensman> It is doing it fine.  I just don't know how to "send" a simple IRC msg/string to a channel I have joined :)

21:05:58 <graylensman> That was Cyc doing that and not my Scheme REPL.
21:06:57 <graylensman> But I really want my REPL to eval this instead.  Since it understands CycL it works better as I can use my overlay functionality like display/query-result.

21:47:04 <dmiles> neat.. so the cooler macros you wrote for definig collections and things in Scheme would start working becasue you evaled it in Schemem and only called OpenCyc when it was part of the API?

22:02:01 <graylensman> Well thats for tomorrow night tho easy.  Just read in the string from IRC and eval it.
