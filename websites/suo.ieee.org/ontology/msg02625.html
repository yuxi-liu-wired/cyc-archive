Nicola,

Thanks for letting us know of your review.  The position that you
consider the mainstream view of logic and philsophy is what I learned
when I was first studying those subjects in the late 1950s and 1960s.

I was taught that modern logic began with Frege, Peano, and Russell,
and was based on Tarski's model theory.  In philosophy, I studied
all the usual topics, which culminate in 20th century analytic
philosophy and natural language philosophy.  I had read William James'
book on pragmatism and learned that he further developed the views of
his friend C. S. Peirce, about whom nobody ever said anything.

When I was a graduate student at Harvard, one of my friends in the
philosophy dept. was doing his dissertation on Frege, and we discussed
some of the issues involved.  He never mentioned Peirce, even though
P's unpublished manuscripts were buried in the Houghton Library
at Harvard, under the care of the philosophy department (which taught
(and still teaches) a course on Frege, but no course on Peirce).
At that time, I bought van Heijenoort's book on the history of
logic from Frege to Goedel, which mentions Peirce in a footnote,
but accidentally omits the fact that the modern notation for
predicate calculus is based on Peirce, not on Frege (and that
Peano gave full credit to Peirce for his notation, and said that
Frege's notation was unreadable).

When I was working at IBM, I was also teaching some courses on
artificial intelligence and logic, in which I presented the received
views on logic and philosophy and related topics.  I also jointly
taught a course on Philosophy and AI with Jack Odell, a philosopher
from the U. of Maryland, who was primarily a Wittgensteinian scholar.

I didn't discover Peirce's logic until 1978, two years after I published
my first paper about conceptual graphs.  After that, I
studied P's logic in great detail, and used it for my Conceptual
Structures book in 1984.  But it wasn't until the late 80's and 90's
that I really delved into Peirce's other work on philsophy.  It was
a great revelation.  I realized that so much of modern philosophy
and logic, which I had so earnestly studied from the "received"
point of view was a pale imitation, or reinvention of what CSP
had done in far greater detail and precision.

Before you finish your review, I strongly urge you to read what
CSP had to say in his Manuscript 514, which was written in 1909,
a year before Whitehead &amp; Russell published the Principia Mathematica:

   <A  HREF="http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ms514.htm">http://www.bestweb.net/~sowa/peirce/ms514.htm</A>

This has my commentary interleaved with numerous references to what
other people had to say about the same topics.

I admit that my Ch. 2 is hard to read, especially for someone who
has already been taught the "received view".  I am now writing a
fully presentation, with commentary on how Peirce, Whitehead, and
Wittgenstein provide a much-needed corrective to that view.

Following is the first section.  I plan to present this topic in
some lectures I will be giving in Australia next week (I'm leaving
this afternoonl and returning on May 26).   I also plan to give this
talk in Brussels, Crete, and Vienna in June.  I hope to see you in
Crete, so that we can resolve some of these misunderstandings.

In any case, I really appreciate your reivew, because it will give
me an excellent chance to present a rebuttal.

Thanks,

John

                  Signs, Processes, and Language Games

                        Foundations for Ontology

                              John F. Sowa

Abstract.  As Heraclitus said, panta rhei -- everything is in flux.  But
what gives that flux its form is the logos -- the words or signs that
enable us to perceive patterns in the flux, remember them, talk about
them, and take action upon them even while we ourselves are part of the
flux we are acting in and on.  Modern physics is essentially a theory
of flux in which the ultimate building blocks of matter maintain some
semblance of stability only because of conservation laws of energy,
momentum, spin, charge, and more exotic notions like charm and
strangeness.  Meanwhile, the concepts of everyday life are derived from
experience with objects and processes that are measured and classified
by comparisons with the human body, its parts, and its typical
movements.  Yet despite the vast differences in sizes, speeds, and time
scale, the languages and counting systems of our stone-age ancestors
have been successfully adapted to describe, analyze, and predict the
behavior of everything from subatomic particles to clusters of galaxies
that span the universe.  Any system of ontology that is adequate for
defining the concepts used in natural languages must be at least as
flexible as the languages themselves:  it must be able to accommodate
all the categories of thought that are humanly conceivable and to relate
them to all possible experiences, either directly by human senses or
indirectly by whatever instrumentation any scientist or engineer may
invent.  As a foundation for such an ontology, this paper analyzes the
achievements of twentieth-century philosophy and recommends a synthesis
of three complementary approaches:  Peirce's semiotics, Whitehead's
process philosophy, and Wittgenstein's language games.

1. The Aristotelian Synthesis

The primary task of ontology, as it was practiced by its founder
Aristotle, is to bridge the gap between what exists and the languages,
both natural and artificial, for talking and reasoning about what
exists.  Aristotle did not state that goal explicitly, but it is the
unifying theme exemplified in his life's work:  the analysis of the
basic principles of every branch of knowledge and their organization in
a system that shows how the diverse subjects are related to one another.
Although Aristotle did not work out all the details himself, he laid the
foundations for the science and technology of the Hellenistic era that
followed him, the great flowering of Islamic civilization in the early
middle ages, and the grand synthesis by the thirteenth-century
Scholastics in response to the clash of the Islamic, Jewish, and
Christian cultures in Spain.  In linguistics, the Scholastics developed
Aristotle's correspondence theory of truth into an early version of
model-theoretic semantics, which they applied to the analysis and
definition of the quantifiers and logical connectives of Latin.  In
fact, the Theory of Propositions by William of Ockham (1323) would still
serve as a good introduction to model theory for linguists who are
discouraged by Richard Montague's formidable notation.

Today, the goal of developing an ontology that can support natural
language processing and knowledge sharing among heterogeneous computer
systems requires such a synthesis.  Following are three systems with the
largest hierarchies of categories, all of which are defined by
Aristotle's method of genus and differentiae:

   * The Cyc system (Lenat &amp; Guha 1990; Lenat 1995) was designed to
     accommodate all of human knowledge. Its very name was taken from the
     stressed syllable of the word encyclopedia. Over 100 person-years of
     effort have been spent on hand-crafting a hierarchy of 100,000
concept
     types with over a million associated axioms.

   * The Electronic Dictionary Research project in Japan (Yokoi 1995) has
     developed a dictionary with over 400,000 concepts, with their
mappings
     to both English and Japanese words. Although the EDR project has
many
     more concepts than Cyc, it does not provide as much detail for each
     one.

   * George Miller and his colleagues (Miller 1995; Fellbaum 1998)
     developed WordNet as a hierarchy of 166,000 word form and sense
pairs.
     WordNet doesn't have as much detail as Cyc or as broad coverage as
     EDR, but it is the most widely used ontology for natural language
     processing, largely because it has long been freely accessible over
     the Internet.

The axioms for Cyc are expressed in full first-order logic with
extensions
for metalevel reasoning about the axioms themselves. But the rules of
inference used for inheriting differentiae through the hierachies of Cyc,
EDR, and Wordnet are based on the patterns of syllogisms defined by
Aristotle and named by the Scholastics: Barbara for inheritance from
genus
to species, Darii for inheritance from species to individual, and the
negative patterns Celarent and Ferio for detecting inconsistencies in the
hierarchy.

Although Aristotle's logic and categories still serve as a paradigm for
the
ontologies used in modern computer systems, his grand synthesis began to
break down in the sixteenth century. Aristotle's physics and cosmology
were
demolished by the work of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. In
philosophy, the skeptical tradition of antiquity was revived by the
publication in 1562 of a new edition of the works of Sextus Empiricus,
whose attacks on Aristotle were popularized by the essays of Michel de
Montaigne (Annas &amp; Barnes 1985). In responding to the skeptics, Descartes
attempted to establish a basis for certain knowledge by starting with
universal doubt, but he merely reinforced the corrosive effects of
skepticism. The British empiricists responded with new approaches to
epistemology, which culminated in Hume's devastating criticisms of the
foundations of science itself. Two responses to Hume helped to restore
the
legitimacy of science: Thomas Reid's critical common sense and Immanuel
Kant's three major Critiques. Kant (1787) adopted Aristotle's logic as
the
basis for his new system of categories, which he claimed would be
sufficient for defining all other concepts:

     If one has the original and primitive concepts, it is easy to add
     the derivative and subsidiary, and thus give a complete picture
     of the family tree of the pure understanding. Since at present, I
     am concerned not with the completeness of the system, but only
     with the principles to be followed, I leave this supplementary
     work for another occasion. It can easily be carried out with the
     aid of the ontological manuals. (A:82, B:108)

Yet after two hundred years, Kant's easy task is still unfinished. His
Opus
postumum records the struggles of the last decade of his life when Kant
tried to make the transition from his a priori metaphysics to the
experimental evidence of physics. Förster (2000) wrote "although Kant
began
this manuscript in order to solve a comparatively minor problem within
his
philosophy, his reflections soon forced him to readdress virtually all
the
key problems of his critical philosophy: the objective validity of the
categories, the dynamical theory of matter, the nature of space and time,
the refutation of idealism, the theory of the self and its agency, the
question of living organisms, the doctrine of practical postulates and
the
idea of God, the unity of theoretical and practical reason, and, finally,
the idea of transcendental philosophy itself."

Before attempting a new synthesis, it is important to understand the
strengths and weaknesses of the Aristotelian achievement and the lessons
that can be learned from it. What, if anything, can be salvaged from it?
What philosophical foundations might be better able to accommodate the
breakthroughs in modern science, logic, linguistics, and computer
science?
What semantic foundations could support the highly technical languages of
science, the colloquial speech of everyday life, and the problems of
finding, sharing, and reasoning with knowledge scattered among millions
of
computers across the Internet? Should Kant's achievements be considered
an
encouraging step toward a new synthesis or a discouraging dead end?
To explore these questions, Section 2 of this paper reviews the highly
technical, but fragmented contributions of twentieth-century philosophy,
and Section 3 considers the possibilities for a new synthesis.

The last four sections of the paper survey the work of three philosophers
who began their careers as a chemist, a mathematician, and an
aeronautical
engineer: Charles Sanders Peirce, Alfred North Whitehead, and Ludwig
Wittgenstein. All three of them lived through the revolutionary
developments in science that made the old systems obsolete, and they were
pioneers in the development of symbolic logic and its applications to
language and science. They responded to the revolutionary changes that
surrounded them by developing systems of philosophy that make room for
the
full range of human experience, thought, and language. The central theme
of
this paper is that Whitehead's process philosophy as a theory of the
flux,
Peirce's semiotics as a theory of the logos, and Wittgenstein's language
games as a theory of semantic change and adaptability provide a
foundation
for a systematic characterization of the universe and its expression in
human language ranging from everyday speech to the most advanced theories
of science and engineering.
