Dear Jon,

I've read ahead a number of messages, and this is a summary of
where I am at present.

In what you say below it seems that you are using a
different definition of what a relation and tuple is to me
(at least).

To you it seems that any construct that has to involve at least
three things to be valid is necessarily a 3-adic relation. The 
problem with this is that a 3-adic relation requires EXACTLY
3 components, not at least 3 components, and that these three
components are necessary for identity.

Relatively few things in real life meet the criterion of exactly
3 components, and though I agree that the example you have used 
of logical operators is one of them, activities generally are not. 
However, even with logical operators it is possible to represent 
these without using 3-adic relations, although I agree that this 
does not remove the three-ness of what is represented. I have 
demonstrated this. You claim (elsewhere) that I have only 
presented tuples, but in fact I have presented fully enumerated 
relations.

Finally, there is still the issue of your claim that things
can be reduced to triads. You have however singularly failed to
provide the solution to this for the measurement example I
presented for those who think this can always be done without
violating the constraints that you wish to impose on others as
to what adacity is.

I'm going to write two brief papers:

1. The transformation of a ternary relation into some set of binary
relations (and vice versa)

2. The use of relations to represent the world about us, practice
and limitations.

These should at least put in one place where I stand currently.

Regards  
      Matthew

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, I think what you *really* want is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the purely generalized form of this axiom,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of which the above is just an instance:
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (forall (?x ?y ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         (&lt;=&gt; (gives ?x ?y ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;              (exists (?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                   (=&gt; (and (giving ?e')
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (giver ?e' ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (receiver ?e' ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                            (given ?e' ?z))
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                                       (= ?e ?e')))))))
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now I think we're getting there.
&gt; &gt; &gt; But even more is needed after the "&lt;=&gt;" to assure that:
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The same giving does not have more than one giver.
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) The same giving does not have more than one given
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) The same giving does not have more than one receiver.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  This actually gets to the heart of the issue quite nicely,
&gt; &gt;      and provides one of the reasons I am unhappy with more
&gt; &gt;      than binary relations.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  You are right that the ternary relation does not only say that
&gt; &gt;      a giving relation involves at least a giver a receiver 
&gt; and a gift,
&gt; &gt;      but that it involves exactly one giver, receiver, and 
&gt; gift.  I think
&gt; &gt;      others have pointed out that this is not necessarily 
&gt; the case for all
&gt; &gt;      givings.  There may be many givers, many receivers or 
&gt; many gifts.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  This is what has driven us away from triadic or higher 
&gt; relations,
&gt; &gt;      rather than anything else.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  So I will now argue that the form that we have ended 
&gt; up with for
&gt; &gt;      giving is actually a more acurate reflection of reality.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; (I'm not quite up to writing what I want in KIF, with certainty.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps someone will step in and add the gory detail.)
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; So,
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) The &lt;=&gt; axiom above is invalid and probably could be used to
&gt; &gt; &gt; prove a contradiction.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) An augmented &lt;=&gt; axiom like the one above but disallowing
&gt; &gt; &gt; two receivers, etc., might not lead to contradictions and
&gt; &gt; &gt; a generalization of it might be OK in the SUO.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) I certainly would not personally want to
&gt; &gt; &gt; call the change from what precedes the &lt;=&gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; what follows the &lt;=&gt; a "reduction".
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; MW:  Indeed, the only thing that is reduced is the arity
&gt;        of the relations used.  On the other hand we do have
&gt;        a more accurate model.
&gt; 
&gt;                   ^^^
&gt; False statement.  |||
&gt; 
&gt; Because I still believe that you really want to know.
&gt; 
&gt; Exercise for the reader:
&gt; 
&gt; What is the arity of the first "and" relation
&gt; that is invoked in the above bit of kiffage?
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                      (and (giving ?e)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (giver ?e ?x)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (receiver ?e ?y)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (given ?e ?z)
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                           (forall (?e')
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; Hint:  It has 5 arguments, and therefore represents
&gt;        a map 'And&lt;5&gt;' such that 'And&lt;5&gt;' : B^5 -&gt; B.
&gt; 
&gt; The use of a single symbol, in the way that "and" is used above,
&gt; to denote a series of operations 'And&lt;j&gt;', for j = 1, 2, 3, ...,
&gt; tantamount to an indefinite degree of equivocation, constitutes
&gt; what is commonly known as a "multigrade operator".  They can be
&gt; very convenient bits of syntactic sugar, but they do not alter
&gt; the underlying logical complexity of the operations invoked.
&gt; 
&gt; This is, of course, aside from the fact that the relation "giving"
&gt; is at least as complex as a 3-adic relation, since its argument is
&gt; at least a 3-tuple -- and you can tell that it's at least a 3-tuple
&gt; from the fact that it has at least 3 components.  That's all that
&gt; a 3-tuple is.
&gt; 
&gt; The basic principle here is:
&gt; 
&gt; | If it looks like a k-tuple,
&gt; | if it talks like a k-tuple,
&gt; | if it walks like a k-tuple,
&gt; | then abduce it's a k-tuple.
