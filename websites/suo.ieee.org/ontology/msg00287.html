Hi Graham,

	I've just incorporated into the merged ontology the Natural Kinds
ontology developed by the ITBM-CNR folks.  I think it does a nice job of
specifying the essential axioms and taxonomic relations for high-level
categories of organisms.  Perhaps you could use this ontology as a basis for
additional biological content.  The merged, SUO-KIF version of the Natural
Kinds ontology follows.

&gt; Subject: SUO: suggested draft vertebrate animal Ontology.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim et al, 
&gt; 	.	I gather no-one replied with a medical ontology. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I'm not sure that this qualifies as an 
&gt; ontology, but I have
&gt; been thinking about having a go at a defining physiology for 
&gt; vertebrate
&gt; animals on Planet Earth. I am trying to guess how much complexity is
&gt; appropriate for the SUO. I suggest this may be appropriate, 
&gt; since it would
&gt; cover so much of the life present on this planet. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	In view of my lack of expertise in the "logical 
&gt; languages",
&gt; it would be in plain English "dot point format", but I would 
&gt; hope it would
&gt; be reasonably unambiguous. I would be happy to assist anyone 
&gt; wishing to
&gt; translate it into SUO-KIF, ACE, etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Basically, I propose to group structures in 
&gt; what appears to
&gt; me to be a logical pattern. 
&gt; *	Body temperature (significant since this is often used as an
&gt; indicator for illness), 
&gt; *	Basic form: 
&gt; *	Skin - the external covering of the entire being of the animal; 
&gt; *	Muscles - the tissue able to be contracted along its 
&gt; length to make
&gt; movements in the being; 
&gt; *	the Vascular system; 
&gt; *	the Nervous system - electrically conductive fibres acting as
&gt; information carriers; 
&gt; *	Body (trunk), containing most organs, and comprising: 
&gt; *	Chest (Thorax), and 
&gt; *	Belly (Abdomen), 
&gt; *	Head, location defining the "top front" of the animal; and 
&gt; *	4 Limbs; 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	The attempt would be to provide a reasonably 
&gt; comprehensive
&gt; generic structure. It would involve breaking things up into 
&gt; logical groups
&gt; that are independent of each other, and go into multiple 
&gt; layers of depth. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Comments, etc. welcomed. If this is not in the 
&gt; nature of an
&gt; ontology, I would appreciate some elaboration of the ways in which it
&gt; doesn't comply with the definition, so I can get a better 
&gt; appreciation of
&gt; what we are hoping to produce. 
&gt;
