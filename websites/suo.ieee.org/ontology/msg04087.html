Welcome to the Free Online Scholarship (FOS) Newsletter
May 15, 2002


Protecting the information commons

Last Friday I spoke at the &quot;Protecting the Information Commons&quot; conference 
in Washington, D.C., sponsored by Public Knowledge and the New America 
Foundation.  This was an advocacy conference.  The mission is to reclaim 
the public domain from the aggressive expansion of intellectual property 
law, and to give voice to the public interest to balance or offset the 
private interests that have the ear of Congress.  I spoke on the Budapest 
Open Access Initiative and represented the information commons that 
consists of open access to scientific and scholarly journal literature.  It 
was a joy to make contact with so many smart, energetic people who are 
pulling in the same direction and willing to lend each other a hand.  FOS 
is just one front in a wider campaign, and it was exciting to talk with 
activists working on the other fronts.  Those working on information 
commons threatened by patents, or by the privatization of infrastructure, 
were as interested in the FOS issues and successes as I was in theirs.

Seth Shulman, who happened to speak at this conference, wrote last November 
that intellectual property critics of many different kinds are being 
brought together in the same way in which environmental movement brought 
together activists on many separate but related issues.
<A  HREF="http://www.techreview.com/articles/shulman0302.asp">http://www.techreview.com/articles/shulman0302.asp</A>

That's how this meeting felt.  Separate strands of public-interest activism 
with overlapping issues are discovering their common ground, their need for 
strength in numbers, and their need for pooled strategies and wisdom.  This 
is a very positive development.

I can't summarize the papers here.  But here are two tidbits of special 
interest to FOSN readers.

* Rep. Rick Boucher told us that the bill he will introduce in a few weeks, 
if passed, will restore fair-use rights denied by the DMCA, and legalize 
circumvention except when there is an intent to infringe.  A bill he may 
introduce after that would prevent contracts (including software, journal, 
and database licenses) from giving copyright owners more protection than 
federal copyright law already gives them.  He also assured us that the 
CBDTPA will not pass.

* Richard Stallman told me that he sees no good reason to use the GPL or 
copyleft for scientific journal articles (see FOSN for 2/6/02).  GLP makes 
more sense for software manuals or textbooks, where new developments create 
a need to modify the original text.  But articles that report the result of 
an experiment, or the observations of a scientist, should not be modified.

Why FOS progress has been slow

The information commons conference made me think, again, about why progress 
in the FOS movement has been slow.  Progress in achieving FOS has been 
accelerating, especially in the past two years.  But compared to the rate 
permitted by our opportunities, progress has been slow.  All the means to 
this end are within the control of scientists and scholars themselves and 
don't depend on legislatures or markets.  We needn't wait for anyone to 
become enlightened except ourselves.  So what is slowing us down?

Scientists and scholars voluntarily submit their work to journals that do 
not pay royalties.  They can self-archive their preprints and some form of 
their postprints without copyright problems.  If they submit their work to 
an open-access journal, then they can publish in a peer-reviewed journal, 
face no copyright problems, and still get open access to their work.  So 
here are authors who consent to dispense with payment, who face no economic 
loss (and much intangible gain) for allowing the free distribution and 
copying of their work, and who face no copyright barriers in authorizing 
open access.  Yet open access to science and scholarship is expanding much 
more slowly than it could.  The other movements represented at the 
conference face more vexing problems than we do:  either flat-out copyright 
(or patent) barriers, or lack of consent from the rightsholders, or 
both.  So if our case is the easy case, why is it so hard?

Stevan Harnad calls this question the *big koan*.  Here's a whack at an 
answer.  There is no single cause of scholarly sluggishness on FOS, but 
here are some of the factors that certainly play a role.

(1) Unlike librarians, scholars tend not to understand the serials pricing 
crisis.  They tend not to understand the licensing and copyright 
(contractual and statutory) problems that are laid on top of exorbitant 
prices to make library access to journals so difficult.  They tend not to 
understand the economics and technology of journal publishing.  I don't 
blame them much.  I had to take a large detour from my own research 
interests to gain the degree of understanding I have now.  Scholars are 
focused on the fascinating first-order problems that attracted them into 
their disciplines (FOSN for 4/8/02), and their talent is to 
concentrate.  But while their focus on other problems is understandable, 
they aggravate this problem by ignoring it.  These are smart people, yet 
they still tend to say, &quot;Don't fix what isn't broken,&quot; rather than &quot;Which 
solution is best?&quot;

Scholars tend to notice that there are access problems to journal 
literature when their own library doesn't carry a journal they need, or 
when nearby libraries will not send a copy by inter-library loan because 
they don't have permission to copy the electronic edition which has 
replaced their print edition.  But when scholars run into access barriers, 
they are slow to realize that these are systemic, not the isolated 
misfortunes of researchers with abstruse topics.

There are many good introductions to the dimensions and details of the 
problem.  Here's one of the best.
<A  HREF="http://www.createchange.org/faculty/issues/quick.html">http://www.createchange.org/faculty/issues/quick.html</A>

(2) There are several myths and misunderstandings about FOS.  The three 
most common and inimical are that FOS bypasses peer review, that it costs 
money that cannot be found, and that it violates copyright.  If true, these 
myths would make FOS undesirable, impractical, and illegal.  But all three 
are false, as you know if you've been following this movement for any 
length of time.  If you are new to the issues and haven't already read 
their full refutation, here are two sources.
<A  HREF="http://www.arl.org/newsltr/220/scholar.html">http://www.arl.org/newsltr/220/scholar.html</A> (scroll to the middle)
<A  HREF="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm</A> (especially the section on 
open access)

(3) Scholars want to publish in prestigious journals, most of which are 
still priced and printed.  Open-access journals can be as prestigious as 
any (see e.g. BMJ).  But most open-access journals are new and it takes 
time for new journals to gather prestige, even if their quality is 
impeccable from the start.  The solution is not to talk authors out of 
their preference for prestige, but to create more open-access journals, 
staff them with first-rate editors, and give them time.

(4) Scholars have a conflict of interest in their roles as authors and as 
readers.  As authors, they want prestigious journals which for the time 
being are mostly priced.  But as readers they want free online access to 
full-text articles.  In this conflict, authors prevail over readers because 
authors decide where to submit their articles.  For a growing number of 
authors who realize that open-access journals give them a much wider 
audience and give their research much greater impact, these benefits 
outweigh prestige.  But there are still many who don't realize that their 
favorite priced, printed, and prestigious journals have a smaller audience 
than open-access journals.  When this sinks in, and especially when the 
prestige of open-access journals grows to match their quality, then the 
conflict will disappear and it will be clear that both authors and readers 
will benefit from open access.  But this will take time.

(5) Insofar as authors are forced by career pressures to choose a priced, 
printed journal over an open-access journal, then the academic reward 
system is also a part of the problem.  Hiring and tenure committees that 
don't give due weight to free online peer-reviewed journals, regardless of 
their quality, make it too risky for untenured scholars to become part of 
the solution.  Ironically, junior faculty who face these pressures are the 
most clued-in and most eager to realize the full potential of the internet.

(6) It is still much more the rule than the exception for journals to 
demand that authors transfer their copyright.  But giving a journal the 
copyright to an article gives it the authority to decide whether access to 
the article will be closed or open.  Since most journals are priced, most 
will limit access to paying customers.  Priced journals wouldn't be 
access-barriers if they didn't have the authority from copyright to decide 
whether to permit open access.

(7) The transition to open access faces certain obstacles.  Priced journals 
want their revenue, either as profit or to minimize their 
losses.  Open-access journals must persuade a variety of institutions 
(universities, libraries, foundations, governments) to accept a novel 
funding model.  Even if paying for dissemination costs much less than 
paying for access, the novelty is a ground for hesitation and the new 
expense may fall where no expense fell before.  I've argued that the 
transition to an open-access funding model may even create a prisoner's 
dilemma (FOSN for 1/1/02).

(8) There are three vicious circles here that affect journal funding, 
author incentives, and author opportunities.  The first is the prisoner's 
dilemma in the transition from the old funding model to the new.  By paying 
for the dissemination of articles rather than access to them, universities 
will realize significant savings.  But they may not be able to afford 
dissemination fees until they can stop paying access fees, and they can't 
stop paying access fees until the dissemination fee business model has 
generally prevailed.  The second vicious circle is that prestige is an 
important incentive for authors to submit their articles to certain 
journals, but new open-access journals can only gain prestige if they can 
give authors an incentive to submit their articles.  The third vicious 
circle is simply that progress has been slow.  This means that there are 
still comparatively few open-access journals where authors can submit their 
work, and there are still comparatively few institutional eprint archives 
offering open access to the research output of their faculty.

Finally, I'd like to emphasize that these are explanations for the slow 
rate of change, not grounds for pessimism.  Explaining why the chicken is 
on this side of the road doesn't mean that it can't walk to the other 
side.  There are many grounds for optimism; just look at the back issues of 
this newsletter.

* Postscript.  The beauty of open access makes it obvious, and its 
obviousness makes it beautiful.  Whichever way one approaches it, one will 
be puzzled why it hasn't spread like fire.  It's even more puzzling because 
open access to scientific and scholarly journal articles is the low-hanging 
fruit of the larger open-access movement.  It's a much easier case than 
open access to other kinds of digital content, such as software, music, 
film, or non-academic literature, because scientists and scholars willingly 
relinquish payment in order to publish their research, advance their 
careers, and contribute to knowledge.

There are roughly two kinds of higher-hanging fruit:  (1) open access 
through copyright reform, and (2) open access through the consent of 
authors who are not yet consenting.  If we can we roll back recent 
copyright extensions, that would move many copyrighted works into he public 
domain.  If we can restore the first-sale doctrine, then libraries may 
purchase digital content and not just license it, and may then provide open 
access to the copies they purchase.  If open-access to novels really 
provides a net boost to the sales of their print editions (FOSN for 
4/22/02), or if open access to digital music gives a net boost to the sales 
of the same music on priced CD's (FOSN for 5/6/02), then more novelists and 
musicians may be persuaded to consent to open access.

We know why these two kinds of open access are distant 
prospects:  copyright reform is hard, and persuading profit-seeking 
creators to consent to open-access is hard.  But our case is the 
low-hanging fruit.  Even if it's not easy to pick, it's easier.  Right?  So 
why hasn't progress been faster?

What's your answer to the big koan?  If my answer is incomplete, what am I 
leaving out?

Developments

* SPARC has entered a partnership with BioMed Central (BMC), in which it 
will help BMC ensure long-term free online access to its line of 50 
journals in biomedicine.  BMC is committed to open access to all its 
journals now and in the future, regardless of the future circumstances or 
ownership of BMC itself.  In its press release, SPARC praised BMC for its 
commitment to open access to scientific research, its bold business model, 
and its concern for sustainability.
<A  HREF="http://makeashorterlink.com/?G55621ED">http://makeashorterlink.com/?G55621ED</A>

* The National Institutes of Health has become an institutional member of 
BMC.  This is the latest in a series of important scientific institutions 
which have endorsed BMC's business model, which provides open access for 
readers and asks authors or their sponsors to bear the costs.

* The Institute of Physics Publishing (IOPP) is digitizing its entire 
archive, which dates back to 1874.  During 2002, the archive will be 
available on the net without charge, but starting in 2003 users will have 
to pay a small access fee.  For this purpose, the &quot;archive&quot; consists of 
issues more than 10 years old.  Putting these texts online will take place 
in three phases, the first of which has now been completed.

* FAIR has announced its winning applicants (see FOSN for 1/23/02).  FAIR 
is JISC's Focus on Access to Institutional Resources, a program to support 
access to institutional content in higher education.  FAIR will fund 14 
projects.

* The Research Libraries Group (RLG) has released a new version Eureka, 
which uses OpenURL to provide context-sensitive links to materials held by 
the user's library.  Eureka uses RLG databases and OpenURL to digital 
resources licensed by a client libraries.

* In a speech last Friday, Thomas Oppermann, science minister of Lower 
Saxony, condemned large scientific journal publishers for price gouging 
that harms university libraries and the taxpayers who support 
them.  Oppermann also argued that their monopolistic prices, which can rise 
by 30% per year, constitute a serious danger for science (&quot;ernsthaften 
Gefahr für die Wissenschaft&quot;).  He has asked Germany's federal cartel 
office (Bundeskartellamt) to investigate them for violating Germany's 
anti-trust laws.  (PS:  Does anyone know of other nations that have noticed 
the harm to taxpayers and who are acting to protect them in this way?)

* The Creative Commons will launch tomorrow.  Currently the web site 
carries only an announcement, but check it again soon.  The Creative 
Commons is a Lawrence Lessig initiative that will draft and print out 
custom licenses for authors, musicians, and other content creators who want 
to provide free online access to their works and yet retain enforceable 
rights e.g. to block the publication of mangled, misattributed, or 
commercial versions (see FOSN for 2/14/02).  Authors will indicate the 
rights they wish to retain by checking boxes on a web from.  Software at 
the site will then assemble a licensing agreement that assigns the 
remaining rights to the public domain.  The creators will mark their online 
work with an icon that links back to the licensing agreement, which users 
may read in either a &quot;lay&quot; or a legalistic version.  The project will also 
act as a conservancy for the content it licenses.

remarkable legislative and legal winning streak....Copyright law has always 
tried to strike a delicate balance between the rights of content creators 
to be compensated for their work and the rights of consumers to use what 
they have paid for. But the development of digital media and Big Media's 
attempt to completely control it have destroyed the delicate equilibrium 
that is copyright law.&quot;

* In the May 13 _Wall Street Journal_ Phyllis Plitch profiles Pamela 
Samuelson, a crusader for copyright reforms that will support an 
information commons and the public domain.

* In the May issue of _Library Management &amp; Information Services_, G.E. 
Gorman asks when digital collections are worth the cost.  He/she lists four 
economic advantages of digital collections (many points of access to one 
resource, flexibility, low production costs, 24/7 availability), and four 
economic disadvantages (piracy, difficulty of setting fair prices, licenses 
that give access without ownership, and preservation).

* In the May issue of _Business 2.0, Matthew Maier creates an annotated 
timeline of 20th century technologies that conflicted with contemporaneous 
copyright law.  In each case, copyright law was revised or reinterpreted to 
allow new and better technologies to emerge.

* In the April 29 _Times Online_, Jim McCue describes the problem of 
archiving the internet:  its large size, its continuous change and growth, 
the ephemeral nature of much of its content, and (as always) 
copyright.  The story is based on an interview with Lynne Brindley, chief 
executive of the British Library.  With the help of IBM, The British 
Library is starting an experiment to archive British content.

* More on the CBDTPA

The May 10 issue of EFF's _EFFector_ has an excellent background piece on 
the industry negotiations that lead to the CBDTPA and the recent decision 
by Phillips to break ranks and oppose it.

* More on the Elcomsoft/Sklyrarov case

Judge Ronald Whyte has ruled against Elcomsoft's constitutional arguments 
for dismissing the charges against it.  Whyte held that source code is 
protected speech, but that the DMCA did not regulate it in a way that 
violates the First Amendment.  Moreover, the DMCA is not unconstitutionally 
vague e.g. for failing to make clear which circumvention devices are lawful 
and which are unlawful.  The reason is that it clearly bans them all.  But 
doesn't that undermine fair-use rights?  Whyte's deeply confused and 
confusing answer:  &quot;Fair use of a copyrighted work continues to be 
permitted, as does circumventing use restrictions for the purpose of 
engaging in a fair use, even though engaging in certain fair uses of 
digital works may be made more difficult if tools to circumvent use 
restrictions cannot be readily [i.e. legally] obtained.&quot;  By eliminating 
these constitutional arguments, Whyte made Elcomsoft's case turn only on 
the statute and the facts.  He also created another precedent to support 
the DMCA against future constitutional challenges.  The trial date will be 
set on May 20.

* More on P2P censorship-bypassing technology

John Borland interviews Ian Clarke, developer of Freenet, for 
_News.com_.  Clarke replies to objections that his software could be useful 
to terrorists and argues that it is needed more than ever since September 
11.  &quot;[T]he only way that terrorists could really use [Freenet] would be to 
share information with the general public....The goal of Freenet is to 
provide a forum for free distribution of information.&quot;

* More on the new EU Copyright Directive

The new directive further limits fair-use rights, e.g. forcing the disabled 
to pay an extra fee to make handicap-accessible versions of digital 
content.  The Library Association Copyright Alliance is fighting for 
amendments that would restore fair-use rights.

* More on the problem of excessive accessibility

The Judicial Conference of the United States has approved an experimental 
plan for 11 federal courts to provide free online access to criminal 
records.  As recently as last September the same group refused to take this 
step on the ground that it would create excessive accessibility to private 
information, even though by law the information must be made public.

* More on the Digital Promise Project and the Digital Opportunity 
Investment Trust

Senator Chris Dodd is submitting a bill to the Senate to create the Digital 
Opportunity Investment Trust (DoIt).  DoIt will be financed by the auction 
of radio spectrum, and administered by the NSF.  It is expected to be many 
billions of dollars.  The trust will support free online digital content in 
the arts, sciences, and education.  Dodd's bill has bipartisan support in 
the Senate.  Rep. Edward Markey is introducing a corresponding bill in the 
House.  In March, members of both houses asked the National Science Board 
(NSB) to undertake an expedited study in preparation for the upcoming 
hearings on the two bills.  The study will be delivered to Congress on June 1.
