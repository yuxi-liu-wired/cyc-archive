Adam,

&gt;Josiane,
&gt;   I think we may not be communicating completely.  I agree that the 
&gt;context of each sentence is different, but the semantics of the relation 
&gt;"on" seems the same in each.
It depends on what does semantic mean.  There is a level of semantics where
you are. I know this approach. But it does not give anything more than what
has already been done in analysis of verbal reports, and especially it leads
to contradictions between the different verbal reports of one participant as
the criticism of introspection has already shown.
If you agree that the context of each sentence is different, where is the
difference ? Is there an infinitely high number of contexts ? so that
nothing has a stable meaning ?
My position is that when stable meanings i.e. concepts are recalled from
memory in a specific task, these meanings are distorted. The study of these
distorsions can give hints upon the construction of new concepts.
My assumption is that one can formalized the ways in which concepts are
distorted. I assume that it corresponds with the characterization of classes
of contexts that it would be very interesting for you to integrate
to your ontology.    

&gt;   As an analogy, consider the following two sentences
&gt;
&gt;1.  John ate the sandwich.
&gt;2.  Sue ate the cheese sandwich before her meeting with John.
&gt;
&gt;The information contained in the two sentences is different but the 
&gt;semantics of "ate" is the same.  Similarly, in
&gt;
&gt;3.  In Bob's dream, he intended to eat the unicorn.
&gt;
&gt;the semantics of "ate" are the same even though situation is hypothetical 
&gt;etc.
&gt;
&gt;We may have different understandings of the word "semantics".  I'm using it 
&gt;relative to the translation to logic of these sentences and the appearance 
&gt;of a term from an ontology to represent the meaning contained in the 
&gt;sentence.  So, to translate these sentences, we might have the following
&gt;
&gt;1.  (exists (?X)
&gt;       (and
&gt;         (instance-of ?X EatingEvent)
&gt;         (performedBy ?X John)))
&gt;
&gt;2.  (exists (?X ?Y ?Z)
&gt;       (and
&gt;         (instance-of ?X EatingEvent)
&gt;         (performedBy ?X Sue)
&gt;         (instance-of ?Z Sandwich)
&gt;         (containsSubstance ?Z Cheese)
&gt;         (objectDestroyed ?X ?Z)
&gt;         (instance-of ?Y MeetingEvent)
&gt;         (participant ?Y Sue)
&gt;         (participant ?Y John)
&gt;         (before ?X ?Y))
&gt;
&gt;3.  (exists (?X)
&gt;       (and
&gt;         (instance-of ?X Dream)
&gt;         (author ?X Bob)
&gt;         (containsInformation ?X
&gt;           (exists (?Y ?Z)
&gt;             (and
&gt;               (instance-of ?Y EatingEvent)
&gt;               (instance-of ?Z Unicorn)
&gt;               (goal Bob ?Y)
&gt;               (performedBy ?Y Bob)
&gt;               (objectDestroyed ?Y ?Z))))))
&gt;
&gt;In each of these formulas, the same term from an ontology "EatingEvent" is 
&gt;used.
&gt;
But perhaps not in the following examples:

He ate some dry bread
He ate on the terasse in the sun 
He ate with his boss
   
I think it is more obvious with 'on'. Your examples are good but look at these

on sunday
to be on the staff
The plate on the table
The plate on the wall
The word on the poster

&gt;Now, it occurs to me that you may have had a different point, which is that 
&gt;"on" refers to a slightly different spatial relation in some of the 
&gt;utterances below.  A box may be "on" another box.  A box may also be "on" a 
&gt;boat but that use of "on" actually means "contained in".  We might also 
&gt;envision a carnival "ring toss" game in which a ring may be "on" a peg 
&gt;although it really is surrounding the peg.  Similarly, I may put "on" a 
&gt;shirt which really means that it completely surrounds my torso.
&gt;
&gt;As a diversion, I'm trying to learn a bit of the Philippino language 
&gt;Tagalog in preparation for a trip there.  Tagalog has a very general 
&gt;preposition "sa" which can variously mean "on", "to", "towards", and "on 
&gt;top of".  This relates to an earlier discussion about how natural languages 
&gt;can lead us astray when it comes to creating good ontologies.  We must be 
&gt;careful to separate ontology and language as there are many concepts which 
&gt;are needed in any rich ontology which don't correspond directly to any one 
&gt;word in a human language.
&gt;
But it would be better if you have had formalized contexts. Such a situation
as learning Tagalog would surely strike you upon contextual composants which
could be considered and formalized.

I have to leave now.
Yours
Josiane


&gt;Do either of the two points above address the issue you're getting at?

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;Could you explain further how the semantics of "on" differs in each of
&gt;&gt; &gt;these sentences?  It seems the same in each - that there are two physical
&gt;&gt; &gt;things and one is above and touching another.  The differences I see in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;sentences are related to the additional information in the sentences.  I
&gt;&gt; &gt;might decompose #1 above as
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;"I" take "pink disc"
&gt;&gt; &gt;Purpose of taking "pink disc" is to perform a task involving "pink disc"
&gt;&gt; &gt;I put "pink disc" on "b"
&gt;&gt; &gt;Purpose of putting "pink disc" on "b" is to enable another task
&gt;&gt; &gt;"I" am_capable of putting "green disc" on "c"
&gt;&gt; &gt;
&gt;&gt; &gt;In each of these decomposed statements involving "on", that relation has
&gt;&gt; &gt;the same semantics.

&gt;&gt;I can understand very well your question and your position about the meaning
&gt;&gt;of 'on' and the fact that it sounds as the same one in the three examples.
&gt;&gt;I can't consider this meaning as the same one in the different examples if I
&gt;&gt;want to give a carefull analysis of verbal reports. It is a matter of
&gt;&gt;context. I studied carefully every occurrences of 'on' in the four trials of
&gt;&gt;Olivier and I was bring to consider in fact that six contexts have to be
&gt;&gt;differenciated:

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;(sorry until now I have translated only trials 1 and 2 ; the two other
&gt;&gt;trials are on the site of PROVERB
&gt;&gt;<A  HREF="http://www.uia.ac.be/webger/ger/cnts/proverb/">http://www.uia.ac.be/webger/ger/cnts/proverb/</A>)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;the two other contexts can be illustrated with the two examples below:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;5 - I take the pink disc to put it on the black disc er #2 on the
&gt;&gt;disc b I want to mean
&gt;&gt;          (4) (3 1) (2)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;8 - I take the disc er the yellow disc I put it on the column c #2
&gt;&gt;          (4 2 1) () (3)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;20 - Then I take the pink disc I put it on the the column
&gt;&gt;          (3 2) (1) ( 4 )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I remember you now the three other examplpes I have had already gave to you
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;1 - Then I take the pink disc to put it on b so that after I can put the
&gt;&gt;green disc on c
&gt;&gt;         (432) ( 1 ) ()
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;7 - So I take the pink disc and I put it on the green disc
&gt;&gt;          (4 2 1 ) (3) ( )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;21 - So that I can take out the green disc er I put it on the black
&gt;&gt;one #2
&gt;&gt;          (3) (1) ( 4 2 )
&gt;&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;Meaning of 'on' in the different contexts
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;         First I will give the way I interpreted these examples:
&gt;&gt;- the context 'on c':
&gt;&gt;It means that there is nothing on the peg; In this case it is difficult to
&gt;&gt;give another denomination.
&gt;&gt;But there are several cases where the peg is not empty, namely in 18-19
&gt;&gt;where a new episod started with the connective 'then' in 18, and another one
&gt;&gt;is starting in 20
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;18 - Then I take the pink disc I put it on a
&gt;&gt;          (3 2 1 ) (4) ( )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;19 - So that I can put the black disc on c
&gt;&gt;          (3 2 1) () (4)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;20 - Then I take the pink disc I put it on the  the column
&gt;&gt;          (3 2) (1) ( 4 )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;It means that at this time the participant do not consider that disks 3 and
&gt;&gt;2 are concerned in the current process solving. He is taking care only of
&gt;&gt;disks 1 and 4.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;- The context 'on the green disk' can be generalized as 'on the colour disk':
&gt;&gt;it means that the colour disk has to be taken in consideration, as one disk
&gt;&gt;at a time, for setting automatically the goal at the situational level, but
&gt;&gt;not of necessity for heeded goal at enunciative level (cf. below episod to
&gt;&gt;which 21 belongs).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;20 - Then I take the pink disc I put it on the  the column
&gt;&gt;          (3 2) (1) ( 4 )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;21 - So that I can take out the green disc er I put it on the black
&gt;&gt;one #2
&gt;&gt;          (3) (1) ( 4 2 )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;22 - I take the  disc I take the pink disc to put it on the green disc
&gt;&gt;          (3) ( ) (4 2 1)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;23 - And I can take out the the yellow disc and I put it on the column b
&gt;&gt;          ( ) (3) ( 4 2 1 )
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;- the context 'on the black one' (le noir, in french) i.e. 'on the colour
&gt;&gt;one' appears as a particular case of the preceding differenciation,
&gt;&gt;introducing a difference between this occurrence of the move of the black
&gt;&gt;disck and the other moves. This denomination occurs in the ended part of
&gt;&gt;trials, one time in trial 1, 3 times in trial 2, é times in trial 3 and 5
&gt;&gt;times in trial 4. I like to think that with this move the participant
&gt;&gt;understand a main event in the organization opf the strategy
&gt;&gt;in example 21 (above)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;- the context 'on the black one' (le noir, in french) i.e. 'on the colour
&gt;&gt;one' appears as a particular case of the preceding differenciation,
&gt;&gt;introducing a difference between this occurrence of the move of the black
&gt;&gt;disck and the other moves. This denomination occurs in the last part of
&gt;&gt;trials, one time in trial 1, 3 times in trial 2, é times in trial 3 and 5
&gt;&gt;times in trial 4. I like to think that with this move the participant
&gt;&gt;understand a main event in the organization of the strategy
&gt;&gt;in example 21 (above)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;- the context 'on the column c' can be generalized as 'on the column peg'.
&gt;&gt;The term 'column c' concerns a set of disks more or less organized as
&gt;&gt;agregates, that the participant intends to move. As the situation of problem
&gt;&gt;evolves this set of disks is more or less spreading through the three pegs.
&gt;&gt;The goal is to move the set of disks. It could be understood as the
&gt;&gt;automatization of the generic goal studied in the modelization I have
&gt;&gt;started for the trial 1 (and whose markers were 'then I can take again' in
&gt;&gt;3, trial 1 - cf my mail 26 May 2001 09:40:08)
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;- the context 'on the column' is a particular case of the preceding
&gt;&gt;differenciation. It appears for the first time in trial 2 in 20 when the
&gt;&gt;participant started to put disks 1, 2, and 3 on the disk 4. It appears again
&gt;&gt;in 26 and 31, which sound as main steps for moving 1-2-3 on disk 4. The term
&gt;&gt;'on the column' means that the problem is quasi-solved from the
&gt;&gt;participant's point of view.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;- The context 'on the disk b', generalised as 'on the disk peg'. It means
&gt;&gt;that the position of the disk on that peg is not in accordance with the
&gt;&gt;progress of the goal. So this position has to be considered as an
&gt;&gt;intermediary one in order to give a rectification of the strategy.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;---------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt;CONCLUSION
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;'on' marks the way in which the process of making the action of put
&gt;&gt;something on another thing was intended. This intention depends on the
&gt;&gt;structure, possibilities and constraints of the considered objects.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Comments :
&gt;&gt;The results I have presented above are issued of my first analysis of
&gt;&gt;Olivier's protocol drawn some years ago
&gt;&gt;I did it in a very carefuy way, but it was a little intuitive (a lot of work
&gt;&gt;for reconstitute every step of the analysis). I did not know how to explicit
&gt;&gt;it. It was the raison by which I start to look at Peirce's theory and at
&gt;&gt;some other semiotic approaches.
&gt;&gt;Now the whole stuff is more advanced and I have to remake this analysis. I
&gt;&gt;think I have some hints in order to  explicit this analysis.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;I hope it gives you some hints about context. And I hope you will ask me
&gt;&gt;more questions.
&gt;&gt;I am ready to make the explicitation of the complete analysis.
