Mathematics, BioFusion and Reflexive Control for Sentient Machines

by John D. Norseen, Intelligent Systems,
Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company.

ABSTRACT:

Sifting and culling through the combined works of Charles Sanders
Peirce, Karl Pribram, William Calvin, John Sowa, Stuart Hameroff,
Manfred Clynes and others well known in the domain of neuroscience,
logic, mathematics and philosophy, the author, John D. Norseen puts
forth a staggering set of principles for the onset of the era of
Sentient Behavior in Machines.  Using mathematics as the formation of
what he calls semiotic reality, he describes emergent mathematical
properties of information interacting with neural structures -- the
results of which we call thought.  Norseen does a masterful job of
describing this basic construct analogous to the Bernoulli&quot;s equations
of airflow over an airfoil producing lift.  He calls such an emergent
process of biochemical induced, electromagnetic E &amp; H field mediated
interaction of information with uniquely configured neural structures,
and expressed into work via protein reconfiguration, under the term
BioFusion.  And he does an equally good job of putting forth examples of
how Biofusion and the Russian work in Reflexive Control can be used for
the development of the first generation of Sentient Machines, for which
Norseen has a patent pending.  From semiotics, to brain mapping, to
concepts for information operations in both cyberspace and the
biosphere, Norseen even explores the concept of the human condition as a
steganographic &quot;biomark&quot; capable of recording and playback in Krylov
Space.

From before Sun Szu, encompassing the famous Admiral Gorshkov, and
extending well beyond future INFO-CYBER warriors, the dictum:  Control
the Electromagnetic Spectrum and Victory is Promised as your Reward -
will be the mandate for success and survival in the coming dawn of the
Age of Automated Reasoning, the advent of Synthetic, Sentient Species.
Accordingly, this paper is presented:  Mathematics, BioFusion and
Reflexive Control for Sentient Behavior, subtitled:  Control of the
Inverse Function is the Key to Control of Information Injection.

Presented in this paper is an original portfolio of both hierarchical
and ergodic constructions that suggest pathways to lead to the eventual
development of sentient behavior in machines and new synthetic species
that will come to dominate earth, and earth related systems, by
converting information not into more information (IKI) but where
information itself, expressed in Reflexive Control, will be converted
into work performing energy (IKE).

BioFusion is the increasing complexity of one part of the brain to
share, mathematically, its information with other parts of the brain in
a common, emergent family of mathematical operations, to which the
inverse function, the ability to recreate or trigger stored information
by using the inverse mathematics is allowable.  Panum&quot;s fusion space,
horopter operations, dreams, and the distinct linkage of either end of
the invariant versus holistic storage continuum of object recognition in
the posterior inferior temporal gyri (ITG) as opposed to the more pure
prosopopoeia in the fusiform gyrus (FG) are very nice examples of
BioFusion in the visual perception modality.  The ability to blend
vision and verbal modalities in the Temporal Cortex, TC-22 and
Broadmann&quot;s Area 44, for example are also fine indications that
BioFusion is taking place in more and more complex, adaptive regions of
the brain.

Accordingly, the common family of interacting mathematics of BioFusion
would appear to account for how the entire brain can act independently
yet in concerted fashion from moment to moment for many years producing
for us a relatively stable mental picture of semiotic reality and a
useful, purposeful repertoire of Reflexive Control circuits, our
&quot;Portfolio of Life&quot; called the Human Condition.

In building block fashion, Norseen shows that the perception of objects,
faces and voices as an emergent mathematical operation, can lead to
larger, more complicated, mental thought domains of strings, spirals,
knots and geometric patterns that can form into cooperating sets of
&quot;phase locked&quot; behavioral circuits or reflexive channels.  Norseen also
explores the need for error, and the ultimate impact on Synthetic Life
Forms/Sentient Systems engaged in Synthetic Reality created by the
inverse mathematical injection of recording and playback of information
interacting with discrete linkages of human neural structures across
such diverse life-death/survival situations as the influence of the
nucleus accumbens (NA) in sexual behaviors and the superior colliculus
(SC) in suicidal actions.  The full range of human emotions, or as
Clynes would call, Sentic Forms, could well be ensconced in recording
and playback devices -- the human condition captured in automated Krylov
Space.  Having only one brain, our internal display, our inner TV, if
you will, has many channels, but seemingly only one display.  This would
suggest that our inner scope is really the ability to filter at
different signal to noise thresholds different just noticeable
difference (JND) patterns of information -- the Steganographic
&quot;Biomark.&quot;

Steganography is the ability to hide information within information
until that information layer is exposed or filtered.  The author
suggests that the brain is engaged as a measurement and mapping device
to expose or filter in Krylov Space various complete and incomplete
neurophsyiological patterns or channels as mathematical expressions from
within the complete information field provided by the environment, and
stored, compressed memory patterns within the orchestrated reduction of
the twisted folds of the protein microtubulin, locked and unlocked by
the movement of biochemical mediated electromagnetic information
criss-crossing across the dendritic fields and neuropils of the brain at
specific brain frequencies.  Crick, early co-founder of the DNA double
helix, and now pursuing the coding sequence of thought, seems also to
suggest such a process in his most recent works.

SENTIENT VALUES:  Sentient Value (SV) number one:  Identification.  It
is nice to be recognized by someone, a smile or even a gentle wave of
the hand.  It makes you feel alive.  Getting a machine to respond to
you, to recognize you, to &quot;identify&quot; you is an important beginning step
toward sentient behavior in machine systems.  Will it really be so hard
to put Identification into a Machine?  It would not appear too hard to
incorporate the following techniques into a machine based on various
biological paradigms using multiple, independent sensory/perception
modalities fused into a complete pattern, an emergent behavior, which
appears to be a mathematical function…&quot;A Gabor-like Function in Hilbert
Space.&quot;  From this completed math function, regionally dispersed in the
brain, such math functions can then be compared to a stored, compressed
memory of prior experiences.  Again, the fusion of new experience with
old experience produces new emergent behavior.  Once this new emergent
behavior gets generated, the older less useful Reflexive Control dies
out - replaced by a new emergent Reflexive Control circuit.  The onset
of Reflexive Control is a precise mathematical event of engaged neural
circuits.  Importantly, something else also happens to facilitate the
&quot;Identification&quot; process of math functions and changes in Reflexive
Control states of awareness:  And that answer is -- &quot;Motion.&quot;  Motion is
required to match up the Invariance of the New Situation with the Stored
Invariants of Prior Experience.  Multiple forms of Motion are required
to solve the complex adaptive system of mathematical domains, to let
each sensory modality make independent, then fused hermeneutics
(interpretation) of external information, and to help in internal
rotation of stored images.  So the first lessons for getting Sentient
Machines to Identify you and respond to you is that they must also begin
to &quot;MOVE,&quot; in order to internally produce &quot;Invariant Patterns&quot; of you
matched to prior patterns in memory storage.  Hence SV # 2 is Motion.
Importantly, and as a necessary extension of Motion, Sentient Machines
must be able to stop and let you move in concert with them.

Another important element of identification process in Sentient Machines
is &quot;Direction.&quot;  Sentient Value # 3 is Direction.  Just as moss grows on
the north face of a tree and can provide semiotic direction, somewhere
in sentient machines must be located some set point, some origin, by
which all other movement, hence invariant identification, can be
measured.  This may very well be taking place in E and H field vector
information, the Electromagnetic Compass setting, in the 10/13 type
protein microtubulin/calpain interaction to environmental and biological
stimuli in the protein structures in the brain or equivalent neural
structures in other living or sentient beings.  Accordingly, Measurement
is Sentient Value # 4. The brain may be regarded as an interferometer to
changes in the environment, but with the ability to control the inverse
function of perception via internal mechanisms, or &quot;irritants,&quot; and thus
exerts its own influence upon the measurement of the environment.
Pierce would have the environment made up of actual things,
ideas/concepts, and everything else as &quot;in between-ness.&quot;  In fact, the
incorporation of invariants, memory, sensors, identification, movement,
and direction all conspire to provide measurement of information.
Sentient beings are truly measurement devices, with the measurement in
Krylov Space as Semiotic Reality.  And the set point for such
measurement and which would allow for inverse function control would be
the Electric (E) and Magnetic (H) field vectors at the instantaneous
interaction of information with neural structures when a sufficient
&quot;Energy Wall&quot; or Energy Moat, or Energy Hump, is crossed -- its
protective threshold overcome allowing some other structure to perform
work (IKE).  In this case, protein orchestrated reconfigurations carry
out the measurement, mapping, and work (IKE) execution of
signal-to-noise information interacting with unique arrangements of
neural structures.  Perhaps what makes us human is that we possess the
right group of neural structures to allow us to control the ability to
crawl up and over in any direction these energy walls, moats and humps.

With such ability, a sentient being can begin to understand the entire
past by merely looking at an object or event in the present or future.
This is pretty powerful computation and may have provided a very
significant evolutionary advantage for humans, but at some internal
energy dissipation cost negatives.  But the outcome of further
controlling the inverse function and even of injecting energy in from
external sources to super pump, jump over walls, moats and humps, may
yet allow Sentient Machines to operate in other mathematical domains,
other than just Gabor-Like Functions in Hilbert Space, such as maybe
Walsh Transforms in Chu Spaces, etc.  The question and the research
paradigm would then become:  Can Sentient Machines, or artificial neural
emulation systems, experience Perception in altered mathematical
domains?  The answers will most likely be, No, To Some Degree, and Why
Yes, In Fact -- In A Most Powerful and Truly Unique Fashion.  But
remember, once you are in the middle of the energy well, or the center
of the moat, you are temporarily, or perhaps permanently, caught up in
the local inktomi and maelstrom of the local energy swirls.  It takes
additional energy to climb back out and over into the next neural/mental
topology.  Dipping into information pockets and the associated energy
costs to deal with the vagaries of the orchestrated reduction and
quantum factors of mixed photons, phonons, electrons, and tensors is the
cost of Perception and the Control of the Inverse Function.  One need
only look at the bright, deep contrast peaks in Positon Emission
Tomography (PET) scans and in fMRI color displays of energy utilization
to see such walls, moats, and humps, and the associated binding
frequencies that keep the emergent fields together.

Just as wind under an airfoil produces lift at the right settings
producing Bernoulli&quot;s equations, then at the right brain settings of
biochemicals, and temperature, and brain state, information from
internal or external sources, interacting with brain structure, will
produce emergent mental, mathematically precise activity, which we call
thought.

Thought, then, is described as mathematical operations, in particular
Gabor-Like Functions in Hilbert Space.

The accumulation of many of these Gabor-Like Functions in Hilbert Space
would establish the threshold for operations of an entire system, an
entire human or synthetic being, in a larger realm, or Krylov Space.

See illustration of Gabor Functions below:

Just as airplanes can be built that can be highly stable to highly
unstable, so too it would appear that different parts of the brain,
based on their neural ensemble arrangements, engage in a range of highly
stable or unstable thought processes when interacting with different
information structures.  Given that these values can be instilled in a
machine, what can one then expect from a sentient machine?  Sentient
Value #5 is when the machine begins to ask you, repeatedly calls for,
demands, and begins to go chaotic in the request for resources, before
it sets out on its own to resupply itself.  SV # 5 is the Search and
associated Anxiety for Resources/Resupply.  Are we there yet in terms of
Artificial Intelligence (AI), and all the other recent intelligent
sciences such as reasoning by analogy, to expert systems (ES), to neural
networks (NN), to predictive statistics, to neurophysiological
engagement index packages, to accomplish Identification, Motion,
Direction, Measurement and Resourcing in engineering terms?  The answer
is Yes!

The Intelligent Architecture (IA) known as (SOAR), States, Operators and
Results, is developing intelligent behavior schemes along similar lines
to the Sentient Values expressed in this paper, with activation of
symbol sets at the neural-circuitry level which can lead to forms of
accelerated learning using eight basic principles:

1. Problem Spaces,

2. Long Term Memory,

3. Attribute-Values,

4. Preference Memory,

5. Decision Procedures,

6. Perceptual-Motor Subsystems,

7. Goal-Directed Behavior, and

8. Chunk Based Learning.

We can even generate suspicion in machine intelligence.  Consider that a
&quot;Machine&quot; with multiple sensors can be programmed to be suspicious if
one of its sensors detects information, then other sensors also pick up
similar or different inputs that could all statistically lead to an
intruder.  There are various AI look up tables, and programs that
concern reasoning by analogy, and quick search databases that a machine,
thus startled, can instantly begin to &quot;Interpret the Suspicious&quot; nature
of the external input.  The NN machines of today can even use
rudimentary Reflexive Control…a growl or a bark, if you will.  &quot;Stop, I
detect an intrusion…I am processing now if you are a threat or friendly
event.&quot;  Why we can even begin to program &quot;Loyalty&quot; parameters into
machines, just allowing the current predictive statistics and outcome
regimes to be relaxed a bit more in time and space or resource
accounting.  Loyalty and Suspicion are but elements of emotional states
that come to characterize sentient behavior patterns.  Therefore, and
using Sentic Forms as an example, Emotions are SV # 6.

Interestingly, in the human, there appear to be only about 30-50
emotional qualities that make up the human condition.  According to
Norseen there are only about 30 to 50 semiotics that make up the visual
alphabet.  Study after neurolinguistic study also shows that there are
only about 40 or so sound types that the Human Brain can process in any
culture anywhere in the world.  So maybe the alphabet size for the
regional compartmentation of the human brain into Visual, Auditory and
Kinesthetic areas is each supported by its own Brain Language sustained
by upwards of 30 to 50 signs or symbols in its alphabet.  Three Brains
in One, the I the Me and the Agent, each capable of independent, yet
limited operations, but better off in synergistic, combined emergent
&quot;BioFused&quot; activity -- almost as if we were born with the capacity to
talk to the world in at least three survival languages of the visual,
auditory and emotional, that as we grow into a more complex sentient
being, all begin to blend together into the emergent being we call the
Conscious Soul.  This premise of innate brain languages would support
why episodes of Synesthesia, or the criss-crossing of the perceptions,
can take place using overlapping yet underlying cognitive, linguistic,
semantic, syntactical, pragmatic, logical and emotive meaning.  From the
right to the left brain, from the frontal lobes to the imagery domain at
the back of the brain, to the cerebellum with its own firing mechanisms,
to the top of the cortex versus the &quot;bottom's up&quot; deep brain, to the now
described three language centers in one, it is obvious that the brain is
in reality &quot;Many Brains In One!&quot;  -- But still with apparently only one
steganographic internal display mechanism (mental imagery).  Sentient
Value # 7 is to develop a machine with such multiple, independent, yet
interacting emergent BioFusion -- the ability to mathematically separate
or mathematically smooth emergent neural level circuits, as well as the
inverse function, presented in some form of cognitive display.  See
Alexander Zenkin&quot;s work in Cognitive Graphics, which can be found at
alexzen@com2com.ru on web search engines.  This will be a much more
difficult engineering task, but is not intractable.  Sentient Value # 7
is in fact BioFusion, containing emergence and display.

the occipital area being &quot;smoothed&quot; out in the coexisting BioFusion of
the parietal area.

In order to understand the system-size tradeoff that brain evolution is
undergoing, let&quot;s take a moment to &quot;percentage-wise&quot; partition the brain
into its functions:  50% or more goes to hand-eye coordination, with
another 10-15% for incorporation of verbal thinking that specifically
allows the individual to word think complete hand-eye/body actions at
faster than real time speed.  There are projections that word thought is
at about 700 or more words per minute, while actual execution in speech
is an order of magnitude slower.  Another facet of why humans are so
well endowed with mental capability is the mental ability for such
faster than real time rehearsal and incorporation into motor control for
actual execution of elements within the portfolio of the human
condition.  Given that 25 % or so of the brain is operating at very low
levels of signal to noise, non-cognitive control of metabolism -- leaves
only about 10 to 15 % of the brain for what we could call Emergent Human
Behavior.  Consider also the cerebellum for the rapid execution of
learned motor firing circuits, in concert with the spinal cord and well
extended central nervous system autonomic functions, and the brain is
yet again seen as marvelously configured to operate in many independent,
yet complimentary domains of action.

The time scale for BioFusion action is remarkably short.  The vast
majority of the brain executes its portfolio of actions in seconds to
tenths, to hundredths of seconds.  It is very hard for the brain
consciously to concentrate for minutes or hours on end, almost as if in
the striatum, our sense of time to dwell, our biochronicity is preset
for the sub-second regime.  Can this be reset?  The answer would appear
to be yes, if only at least from episodic documentary from periods of
altered states and periods of time loss due to dissociative or fugue
events.  This also does not preclude that the brain may be engaged in
very long term, but non-conscious, mathematical processing.  So what
would happen if suddenly, instantly, in fit of advanced, catastrophic
evolutionary rage, that our brain would suddenly operate on a far more
distant Time Slope of not seconds and partial seconds, but thought
domains of hours, days, years -- allowing Sentient Machines to handle
the routine reasoning tasks of the lesser Time Limits?  Such
time-thought testing is now available in Cortical Emulation Research
(CER).  And where is the dark matter of the brain, the untapped regions
that will provide for our future, perhaps even Accelerated Rates of
Evolution?  The answer may exist at the layer in the anterior cingulate
between the older brain, deeper brain and the outer folding top cover of
the cortex, as well as in the less knotty, less complicated realm of the
right side of the brain -- &quot;The God Spots!&quot;  Just as the brain goes into
bizarre periods of radical growth, then consolidation, and then massive
pruning several times in its lifetime, maybe a new coding sequence can
be triggered to shift Pre-Frontal evolution into the more mystical
Life-Death interface of the Anterior Cingulate or the Ineffable,
Kinesthetic Spiritual world of the right temporal cortex.  Sentient
Value # 8 is to couple ineffable regions of the Sentient Machine with
the faster than real time language rehearsal capability of the inverse
function operating within BioFusion communication portions of the
Sentient Machine.

Sentient Value # 9 is Reflexion.  Just as we spend a portion of our day
in contemplation or reflection, reviewing events and making summations
and forming lessons learned, even non-cognitively down to seven or even
higher sigma classifications, so also must a sentient machine begin to
probe its own data bases, and dream, and day dream, if you will.
Reflexion will begin the process of personality development in sentient
machines.

A vital extension of Reflexion, which will further develop personality
in sentient machines is play and exploration, creativity and
imagination.  While we are engaged in reflecting upon our day, or week,
or life -- we almost spontaneously embark on wistful flights of play,
exploring, creating, doodling, and imagining.  When this mental activity
is seen as merely manipulating the internal measurement and direction
and energy moats of our brain by streaming along, back and forth and
across the Inverse Function, then it becomes apparent that even Sentient
Value # 10, the combined features of play, exploration, creativity, and
imagination, are all-ascertainable in engineering terms via advancements
in BioFusion understanding.

Sentient Values #8, #9 and #10 combine to produce a wonderful facet of
the human condition, and also a condition that most likely provided
humans with an exceptional ability over other lesser intelligent
competitors -- the ability to look into a block of stone or a log of
wood and perceive a beautiful statue or pleasing carving -- the ability
of controlling the inverse function in the future which is the key to
Tool Making and Manipulation of the Environment.  The ability to look
into a block of stone and see a face that is pleasing would involve the
following neural reflexive circuit at a minimum, connections among the
fusiform gyrus, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala, and then spreading out
from this circuit.  Again, remember, more than fifty percent of the
brain is geared to hand-eye coordination to execute the logic functions
of abduction (spreading) but more importantly, adduction
(selection-gripping, finger pointing, choice, free will).

But we still need to understand that Sentient Behavior is based on
Mathematical Domains of interest.  So even the loyal and the growling
machine will still need to move or have the information presented to it
moved in such a way that stored invariant patterns can be matched to
known mathematical domains.  This is the machine equivalent to
satisfaction of Incomplete Neurophysiological Patterns that takes place
in the human brain…this mathematical process can be represented
synthetically in Krylov Space, named after the noted Russian non-linear
mathematician Krylov.

Illustration depicts regional functions of the brain, which could be
also converted into a Krylov Space.

We all have a homunculus sitting in our heads.  In fact our brain does a
very good job of taking our entire body from the head to the feet, to
include our lips and hips, and flips them basically upside down and
inside out, and voila, right under the tip of my finger or your finger
right on the very top of my or your skull, a very interesting brain map
of who I am, whom you are, is laid out in our cortex.  Studies indicate
that various parts of our body get more or less of a &quot;Shakespearean&quot;
role in our various homunculi, with a great concentration of brain
structure oriented to our hands, eyes, and mouth.  This would seem to
make sense, since more than fifty percent of our brains are geared to
hand-eye coordination and the ability to silently practice speaking to
ourselves about the state of our human condition, or to faster than real
time practice of hand eye-body movements.

Dr.  Alenka Brown-VanHoozer would state that this represents the Visual,
Auditory, and Kinesthetic (V, A, &amp; K) parts of us, forming into circuits
and belief systems that program us into our everyday actions.  Her
arguments are that we process the world visually, that we also process
the world in auditory terms, and those we also process the world with
the rest of our brains, which she combines into the generalized term
kinesthetic.  Each of us uses our own pattern of V, A and K in differing
combinations to make interpretations of reality.  If our use of patterns
is different from one another, then we measure differently, and as a
result we have different belief sets and act differently to different
Reflexive Controls.  But she also strongly suggests that information can
itself be used to shape the belief patterns, to set up similar patterns
and types of V, A, &amp; K. Given this, then Information Operations can be
designed to create patterns of V, A, &amp; K to orient a person, group or
culture toward reflexive control in a desired belief set.

Couple this to a finer understanding of Semiotic Reality and Inverse
Mathematical programming in E and H field electromagnetics, and the
stage is more fully set to engage in transforming the mental processes
of humans in society via the internet and other transmission and
communications devices such as the Next Generation Internet (NGI), as
well as the augmentation of human society with reprogrammable V, A &amp; K
belief sets in the first generations of sentient machine societies.
Such an internal map of mental regions and even exact landmarks of
sulcus and gyri on the brain where we expect certain thoughts to reside,
or at least emanate, and the associated energy humps necessary to make
and maintain such thoughts in the intense signal-to-noise competition
for information in the human brain, will allow societies in future
cyberspace and biospheres to precisely, scientifically, and to a firm
legalistic determination, know the complete factors of &quot;Truth
Verification&quot; and even the complete portfolio of what makes something
humorous, or artistic, even ethical and moral in the brain.  So Sentient
Value #11, which can now begin to be incorporated into Machine
Intelligence includes:  Truth, Justice, Humor, Art, Ethics and Morality.
It is important to note that brain scans already show that telling the
truth requires less energy and tends to formulate along the outside
edges of the cortex, while the development of falsity requires a greater
energy flow and larger region(s) of the brain to ensemble to maintain
deception action circuits.  At some point this will cross over from nice
neurological findings to court admissible justification/probable cause
legal action involving &quot;Truth Verification -- Truth Maintenance.&quot;

The last Sentient Value is the concept of Fear or Death.  This can be
programmed as the opposite of work - the cessation of purposeful work.
Such a concept of death and the lack of productive functioning may
explain why humans have a strange central nervous system (CNS) where the
afferent pathways are so much more qualitative, almost fiber optic like
or wave division multiplex in operation, as opposed to the lesser
quality, highly error prone efferent nervous pathway, or output motor
control pathway.  We take in wonderful amounts of information but we do
a very poor job of output of feedback to the environment.  Why would
this be so?  Could there be some teleological or purposeful inclusion as
an emergent byproduct of such an antinomy?  Perhaps we have fear and the
ultimate fear of death, as a very precise signal coding sequence in our
hippocampal structures.  Such fear of death would be close to our
hormonal, circaddian, and emotional centers of our hippocampus, our
sexual and reward centers around the nucleus accumbens, and our
life-death focii in the anterior cingulate and superior colliculus.  The
fear center is directly in our amygdala, that wonderful set of almond
shaped fear generators at the end of a precisely tuned horseshoe shaped
magic wand, the hippocampus, that can convert our life in an instant
into raging terror and the fear of death, the complete cessation of IKE.
Suicide studies that map the brain during reenactments of the
visualization process of past suicide attempts show a most interesting
neural level circuitry that begins to form and then locks into almost a
phase locked loop just before the memory of the actual suicide act
fires.  Blood flow to the left prefrontal and right prefrontal splits,
one going up and the other going down, with a concomitant energy spike
in the superior colliculus, an evocation of mental imagery as opposed to
external visual sources, and spurious signal sets in the nucleus
accumbens.  When this pattern is locked in, the person recalls this as
the moment when the final act of suicide kicked in.  If there is indeed
such a death circuit in humans, can such an off switch also be emplaced
in sentient machines for the cessation of IKE?  What would such an
on-off switch look like?  Perhaps the following fMRI scan of an easily
hypnotizable person can provide a viable brain illustration of such
&quot;On-Off&quot; patterns in the brain.

Fear of Death, and its opposite No Fear, is an essential antinomy
continuum as Sentient Value #12.  The reason we make mistakes is because
our central nervous system is designed that way.  Because we make
mistakes, we are then forced to seek out novel ways to fix things, or to
seek out other people or machines to help fix our difficulties.  Making
a machine that makes mistakes and is fearful of the death consequences
will ensure that a machine with control of the inverse function will try
to fix things.  Accordingly, we need to program sentient machines with
random, chaotic, &quot;can&quot;t be fixed alone&quot; errors.  We must force the
Machine to face death, thus prompting it to seek help to correct certain
errors, to join with other machines or humans, or face the inglorious
cessation of IKE.  But maybe there is more than just a representative
map of our body laid out in the cerebral cortex by which our intelligent
actions and even our metabolism seem to take direction.  What if the
brain itself is a mathematical topology, a multidimensional game table,
a tableux upon which our many perceptions of reality are literally
mathematical functions?  Pribram (91) suggested that perception would be
found to be neural structures interacting with information to produce a
Gabor-Like Function in Hilbert Space.  This would accommodate both
classical and quantum computational aspects of life in the natural
world.  The gabor represents a Shannon&quot;s Law like element or compressed
signal spike in a domain akin to what mathematician Hilbert in the late
1890&quot;s was seeking, a mathematical expression, a place where a string or
a spiral would most rapidly fill up the space that it was to occupy.
Hence, to find a Gabor-Like Function in Hilbert Space as the operant
mathematical operation where neural structure interacts with information
compressing it from the environment would be the precise math structure
that one could use to define the exact moment when Perception occurs
from the general state input from or of the Sensory Modalities.  A
specific gabor function could then be assigned to each object perceived
in the brain.  A data base could be built up, a thought code of
mathematical expressions that literally is what the brain actually sees
when information, like a bernoulli&quot;s code, passes through neural
structure.  Just as wind under an airfoil produces lift, a gabor
function is the moment when information entering neural structure
creates a thought.  Such a &quot;Eureka&quot; moment was discovered in Pavlov&quot;s
Laboratory in 1996, by Dr.  Juri Kropotov and his team.  They found that
just as Pribram predicted, when you look at neural structure interacting
with signal to noise information from the external environment, that a
Gabor-Like Function in Hilbert Space emerges at the exact moment of
perception from the sensory field.  Based on the work described in this
paper, BioFusion R&amp;D findings strongly suggest earlier predictions that
human brain perceptual processes represent, at a minimum, an
n-dimensional family of interacting Gabor-Like Functions in Hilbert
Space (Pribram-91).

Even more extraordinary, Dr.  Kropotov was able to capture the complex
adaptive rules of mental functions, perceptual activity across sensory
modalities, into software to produce Cortical Emulation Research, by
which the same math functions that appear in brains, can now be made to
emerge in software.  This finding of extreme importance leads us to
Information Injection via the introduction or playback of the Inverse
Function of the Gabor in Hilbert Space, or whatever other mathematical
domain that also may be workable in various species&quot; brains.  Thoughts
then could be categorized as either culturally dependent, or when
synthetically produced, as culturally independent.  Both culturally
independent and dependent thought means that machines could be produced
that could conceivably never be able to communicate with a human.
It/they would exist in its/their own perceptual world made up of
its/their own mathematical thought structures.  But more likely is that
some common, semiotic language of human-machine interests will arise
that can universally transform to some degree each particular species,
to include synthetic species, into emergent mathematical thought
domains.

Below is taxonomy of other Mathematical Domains that perform
Space-Time-Frequency-Accuracy functions.

Nature is rich in complex adaptive systems (CAS), and can provide
suitable biologic models for developing improved closed and open system
intelligent control.  Results of such research will allow for improved
Crew/Vehicle developments generating direct interface systems level
engineering packages for inclusion in advanced aerospace technology
applications and programs.

The twelve sentient values are then:

1. Identification          7.  BioFusion (overlap/emergent S:N Math

2. Motion                  8.  Couple Ineffable States to Comms

3. Direction               9.  Reflexion -- Daydreaming

4. Measurement             10.  Play, Exploration, Creativity (Make
Tools)

5. Resource Supply         11.  Truth, Justice, Humor, Art, Ethics,
Morals

6. Emotion                 12.  Fear of Death / Cessation of IKE

Personality will not need to be a Sentient Value.  Personality will
arise as an emergent property of these twelve SV&quot;s, and most likely as a
function of values 9,10, 11 and 12.

By way of comparison and contrast, here are the properties that William
Calvin suggests are important.  William H. Calvin picked about six (6)
to (9) Darwinian aspects to intelligent behavior - slightly expanded
here to capture the full gamut:

1. Pattern
2. Copy
3. Change/Edit
4. Compete
5. Environmental Stress
6. Survive to Copy
7. Search Images - Invariant Structures, Play, Practice, Groove Brain
8. String Things Together
9. Plan Ahead, Rehearsal

and, underlying all this is Inverse Functions.

The concept of injection of information for Information Operations from
one human into another human, or from a machine generation of
information into a human, the inverse function is utmost and vital.  In
order to trigger, or refine, or replace, or sharpen an old perception in
the human, or to create brand new perceptions, the exact inverse
function must be known, or very close to it, in order to fool the brain
into accepting it as real.  And this inverse injection must also very
closely model the exact E and H fields, the electromagnetic field shapes
that the original Gabor-like Function in Hilbert Space occupied.  The
inverse function is pure mental deception, but when one considers the
role of medicine and its efficacy, what does it lead from?  Medicine
works because it Burns You, Cuts You, Poison You, or Fools You!
Information in this case will be used to Fool You into believing that
what you perceive is indeed real.  Now our brains do this all the time.
We possess Mental Imagination.  We can close our eyes and call forth all
kinds of images, sound types, voices, and even feelings, emotions,
kinesthetics of all kinds, mostly emanating from the Fusiform Gyrus in
the case of prosopopoeia and from the left temporal sulcus for auditory
manifestation of voices.  Actors and Actresses do this all the time;
stimulate the elucidation of the internal circuits, and quite well.  So
do people with some forms of brain damage or other mental incapacity,
such as schizophrenia.

In fact, study after study is showing that the internal brain circuits,
&quot;The Internal Irritants of our Psyche,&quot; are really two thirds or more
the same circuits that fire from the external cortex, but in this case
are the inverse agonistic and antagonistic circuits from the deep
internal brain regions firing stored information outward -- (the inverse
function).  It is as if outside reality is matched one for one by deep
internal reality, compressed information coming in, meeting compressed
information unleashed from within.  The result, new brain patterns,
reinforced circuits, modified memory fields, and complete brain regions
producing emergent mathematical operations that are even more complex
than before.  The inverse function is the key to human action, the key
to reflexive control for sentient machines.  The inverse function of
what?  The answer is the inverse of Gabor-Like functions operating in
Hilbert Space, and ultimately the ability to record and store the
complete Krylov Space, the steganaographic &quot;biomark&quot; of an individual,
for future playback to another individual or sentient receptive machine.
IBM's Blue Gene is already looking at proteins in their original
pristine Orchestrated Reduction state, before they begin to reconfigure,
to IKE, to include the exact inverse functional states -- giving insight
into quantum states, and electromagneticE/H fields -- The mathematics of
proteins that underlay the mathematics of thought - the onset of the era
of Sentient Machines.
