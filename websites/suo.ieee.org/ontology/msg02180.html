<BR>
Not quite right, since the notion of a possible world (that is,<BR>
possibilities made manifest in a hypothetical spatio-temporal ensemble)<BR>
and (to use Kotarbinski's early contribution to possible world semantics)<BR>
of an "empty name" as what computer people might call a 'wild card'<BR>
standing for such a world is something short of the philosophical category<BR>
of modality. <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Is it? If so, then, it must be that this philosophical category has never been successfully formalized. All the formal modal logics every devised can be interpreted in a possible-world model theory, a basic insight due to Kripke. (A quick correction: there is nothing in the notion of possible world that requires it to be a *spatio-temporal* ensemble.)<BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Modality in its best developed sense is the notion of<BR>
possibility detached from (or better, prescinded from) time and space. <BR>
The view you espouse is workable but more limited; in it possibility is<BR>
postulated to be always conjoined with some space-time instantiation<BR>
(which may be placed hypothetically in the past, present or future)<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
The idea that I suspect Matthew is after allows spatiotemporal ensembles which are not in the past, present or future of the one that we are in; these are often called "alternative timelines". Which is why the notion transcends purely tamporal modalities. <BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>rather<BR>
than seen a fundamental category in its own right.  Possible worlds theory<BR>
is certainly an advance over the attempt to absorb possibility into<BR>
potentiality, but it is a step short of a view of multiple, indeed,<BR>
infinite possibilia for each and every sign.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
Whatever that last sentence means, it isn't what logicians mean by 'modality'.  Like much of Peircian lore, it smacks more of theology than any other science.<BR>

<BR>
If your distinction between the 'how' and the 'what' of the view of giving<BR>
is designed to highlight the issue of meaning, then I agree.  If I see two<BR>
people grasping an object and releasing it from one to the other, that, I<BR>
take it, is the 'what' you are referring to.  Viewing this 'what' as an<BR>
act of giving is the 'how' I might view it.  Similarly, two people<BR>
emitting sounds at each other and responding mutually in body language in<BR>
a kind of dance of the eyes, gestures and facial expressions, is a 'what'.  <BR>
Viewing this as a "conversation" is a 'how'.  If this captures what you<BR>
have in mind, then my argument is that a 'how' that captures the<BR>
meaningfulness of the act to the actors requires some tertium quid beyond<BR>
the physical dynamic.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
There are several issues getting confused here. One, there might be some things 'beyond the physical dynamic' which need to be taken into consideration in describing the world. Two, there is an inherent need for ternary relations. These two issues have nothing to do with one another. The first is deserving of long discussion, but the second, taken at face value, is just plain wrong. Anything that can be said using n-ary relations can be said using only binary relations, if the 'saying' is allowed to use the normal apparatus of modern logic, ie in particular if it can use existential quantifiers and conjunction. This in fact follows from Peirce's own argument for the irreducibility of triadicity, ironically enough, since Peirce showed that anything could be said using binary relations plus ternary identity; but in modern logic, ternary identity can be defined as follows:<BR>
<BR>
TI(x,y,z) &lt;=> (x=y &amp; y=z)<BR>
<BR>
Now, one might have objections to this translation on various grounds (it fails to provide an 'adequate analysis' (Awbrey), or it misses the essential triadicity of the use of a name three times (Sowa), or it fails to 'cover' identity properly, or whatever) but the fact remains, that it exists, and it preserves truth. And by so existing, it establishes the elementary fact that, to repeat, anything that can be said using n-ary relations, can be said using binary relations. So it is pointless to simply *deny* this fact. What might be worth doing is stating the thesis that you believe in more carefully, so that it has a snowball's chance in hell of actually being true, rather than simply reiterating a logical absurdity as though it were Holy writ.<BR>

<BR>
Yes, I agree: your key term here is "support views".  What is actually<BR>
happening is that the ternary view is added by the user, who is supplying<BR>
the element of interpretation that the binary structure leaves out. It is<BR>
the user's "view" that is being "supported."<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
So, make the binary structure into a thing, and relate the user to it, and everything is described in binary terms. If this misses something vital out, *what does it miss*? It preserves truth; what else is there to preserve? The ball is in your court to explain what you feel is wrong with this style of analysis in terms which are exact enough that we can cash them out in ontological engineering. <BR>
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>> <BR>

<BR>
And as replied above, the possible worlds approach still contains the<BR>
concretist grounding but attempts to correct its obvious limitations by<BR>
detaching it from the actual world to hypothetical worlds and<BR>
quasi-worlds. Within a certain range this will 'work'.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
It works for every modal formalism yet invented, as far as I know. In fact it is the ONLY thing that works. <BR>

<BR>
Though this is not really an email topic, let me try a quick, somewhat<BR>
fanciful example.<BR>
<BR>
Suppose we drew a line and cut it at an arbitrary point, and at the cut<BR>
there exploded an infinity of possibilities not only for resolving the<BR>
point into a continuum of infinitesimals, but for the 'how' (in your<BR>
sense) of viewing each infinitesimal.  Is it useful to construe one as<BR>
opposed to another infinitesimal variation as defining a distinct<BR>
'possible world'?  Or would we want a less inflated vocabulary for<BR>
handling these variations?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
There is a subtle point here about logical interpretations. A theory might have models in which there are large infinities, without the theory having a large vocabulary. Indeed in many respects the inverse is true: it takes a large vocabulary to *rule out* the models with large cardinalities.  For some lovely examples of this see <FONT face="Palatino">Van Benthem, J. F. A. K. (1983) <I>The Logic Of Time</I></FONT>, where quite simple temporal theories are shown to have all kinds of outrageously infinite 'nonstandard' models. For example, suppose the theory simply refers to a partial ordering of timepoints, with every time having a unique past but possibly more than one future. This tiny axiomatic theory has models in which every timepoint has an uncountable infinity of immediate temporal successors. Now suppose that the theory insists that time is totally ordered, so the future is unique; this can be done by adding one simple axiom. This theory has models in which infinitely long series of times can be interpolated between any two times. And so on. <BR>
<BR>
So questions about what possibilities are contemplated by a theory as what might be called ontological alternatives, and questions about the vocabulary of an ontology, need to be sharply distinguished from each other.<BR>
