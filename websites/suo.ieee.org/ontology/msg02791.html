The exemples below refer to protocol Olivier, trials 1 and 2, given in a
separate mail
The examples are carefully translated and every criteria which has to be
taken in consideration is translated from french to english. The french
protocol is presented on the site
<A  HREF="http://www.uia.ac.be/webger/ger/cnts/proverb/">http://www.uia.ac.be/webger/ger/cnts/proverb/</A>


I - Formal characteristics

disk 1 = black disk (the little one)
disk 2 = green disk
disk 3 = yellow disk
disk 4 = black disk

peg a = starting peg where all the disks stand, the little disk is above
disk 2, which is above disk 3, which is above the biggest disk 4

peg b = the intermediary peg
peg c = the goal peg, where all disks have to be in the same order

constraints :
one disk at a time
not a big disk on a little one 

Furthermore if necessary I use to characterize the position of disks with
the variables below:

- sectors : the triangle (which represents the problem space) is divided in
four sectors
S1	top right Side
S2	top left Side
S3	bottom left Side
S4	bottom right Side

-goals : 
G4	disk 4 moves to peg C
G3	disk 3 moves to the place from which disk 4 can move to peg C
G3/4	disk 3 moves to peg C on disk 4
G1/2	disks 1 and 2 move to peg C on disks 3 and 4.

- Batches of manipulations
B4	sequence of manipulations ending by move of  disk 4
B3	sequence of manipulations ending by move of  disk 3 before disk 4 can be
moved
B3'	sequence of manipulations ending by move of  disk 3 after disk 4 has
been moved one time
B3/4	sequence of manipulations ending by move of  disk3 onto disk 4
B1/2	sequence of manipulations moving disks 1 and  2 onto disks 3 and 4

These three sets of variables could be used for different decompositions of
problem space in subsets. Different studies I have drawn with my students
show that these decompositions are pertinent on the cognitive level. Their
elaboration relies on general observations drawn from different protocol
analysis. But they remain quasi-formal ones because they have nothing to do
with the analysis of protocol Olivier. I do not know if this is useful at
the level of supervisory control mechanism.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------

II - General characteristics issued from the linguistic analysis of  protocols

1 - General organization
(a)  every disk (1, 2, 3, 4) can be a solid, real disk, and a disk detached
of reality.
(b) detached disks (or detached pegs) could be elabored either from :
- a partition between properties of a solid disk (or solid peg) : peg b can
give rise to different denominations such as disk b, green disk, column,
column b
- or from a generic reference to several disks (or pegs ?): disk b could
refer to diisks 1 et 2, and disk c to disks 3 and 4
- or from an integration of several disks : the pink yellow disk which is
refering to the set disk 1 or disk 3, and which can refers either to solid
disk 1 or to solid disk 3

(c ) a detached disk can belong either to enunciative space as selected disk
(criterium = anaphora, for example : 'the yellow disk I put it on column
b'),  or at situational level (if no anaphora). Furthermore an orthogonal
space to both situational and enunciative levels when two selected disks,
connected or not at enunciative level, are connected by the way of the
situational space. 

(d) detached moves can be considered too at situational level and at
enunciative level, if there are differences between linguistics marks
denoting real moves of solids disks. Detached moves belong to enunciative
space if they concern moves of selected disks;  they belong to situational
space if they concern detached disks of situational spaces.

(e) enunciative level corresponds to heeded activity ; situational level to
automatic activity. Situational level can be considered as the context of
enunciative level. But in case of impass, it can work as a parallel heeded
space (and it allows to construct new rules for moving solid disks, it is
the case in trial 3 of Olivier - we'll see that later)

(f) several levels of abstractions (i.e. of heeded activity accordind to the
different kinds of putting into perspective occuring at linguistic level)
can occurs in both enunciative and situational levels.

 (g) even if enunciatiative and situational levels are independant they
could enter in relation :
- through the fact that detached disks refers to solid disks, and detached
moves refer to real moves
- through the critical goals (criterium : modal verb), whose function is to
construct another representation, and therefore to turn back to the
properties of the corresponding solid disks.

(d) the separation between enunciative level and situational level can
evolve with the expertise (an analog construction and structuration of
objects, moves, automatization can be set up at situationnel level)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------
2 - Construction of agregates

2.1 - Regrouping of elements   

2.1.1. locations at situational level (criteria:  repetition of denomination
of elements). The repeated element is automatically stored in long term
memory with its properties and the local state to which it refers in the
complete problem space. So then it starts to be detached from the real and
solid elements.
 - repetition of the denomination of the peg in case of 'situational
locations on the peg (example: trial 1, 11-12 with repetition of 'on C'): it
establishes a partition between moves of solid disks considered as
susceptible to be moved to that peg, and moves which are not be considered
as  able to conduct to this peg. 
- repetition of the denomination of the disk in case of situational
locations on the disks (example: trial 1, 5-6 with the repetition of 'yellow
disk');  it establihed a partition between disks considered as able to go on
disks 3 and others which are not.
N.B- locations at situational level may occur between solid disks associated
to selected disks. In this case, they allow to linked selected disks through
the situational level.
N.B. first results of a qualitative study (actualy drawn with one of my
students) show that generaly situational locations on the disk or on the peg
appear with 10 year olds either just before the move of a big disk (disk 3
or disk 4) or just after in case of regrouping or spreading the set of disks
1-2. So when it is not it can be interpreted as a conlict between the
automatic goal and the current solid state of the problem. For example in
trial 1 for 14-15 and after the location on the peg of 13-14 


2.1.2. locations at enunciative level
- repetition of a selected disk in case of locations on the disk; example in
trial 2 for 3-4 with the repetition of 'the yellow disk'
- connective linking moves of two selected disks. 
- connective linking the move of a selected disk and the move of a
situational disk;  example in trial 2 for

N.B. It is not clear here for location of moves at enunciative level. I have
to work that point a little more in order to give a theoretical
differenciation of criteria. I think of link between relation for moves and
repetition of disks for locations on disks. But it is complicated by the
fact that moves of enunciative level are linked with moves of situational
level; for example in 12-13 where 'the pink disk' in 12 is a selected one,
but 'the green disk is a situational one.
My first modelizations are disturbed by my recent data.
It seems to me that locations between moves at this level is the first step
of chunking between moves



2.2.1. regrouping of elements at situational level with the repetition of
the located disk
t does not appear inthis protocol, but it is very frequent for some kind of
protocols without selected disks.

2.2.2. regrouping of elements at enunciative level with the repetition of
the selected disk, for example in 14-15 with the repetition of 'the pink disk'

2.3. Demarcation of episods (I give here only criteria for Olivier, trials 1
and 2): it defines the structuration and the boundary of agregates of disks
and of moves at enunciative level, and at situational level. It define also
the structuration of planning.
- criteria at enunciative level : change in the denomination of a selected
disk; example trial 1, in 18 and 31, with 'the disk b', while the
denomination of other selected disks is a color disk. Another criteria
stands in connectives 'then' in 3 (reenforced by at the time in 4), 23, 28.
The criteria established with connectives can be considered as hierarchicaly
higher than criteria with the change of denomination of selected disk.    
- criteria at situational level : change in the denomination of the peg;
example in 4, 6, 10, 21, 30 (color disk), and in 18 (on the disk c).
Furthermore another criteria has to be taken in consideration with the
double denomination of the peg; example in 22 with 'on the green disk on b'.
This last criteria (double denomination) can be considered as hierarchically
higher than the single change of denomination.
N.B. demarcation of episods are not in phase at situational level and at
enunciative one. Only the demarcation at enunciative level seems to worked.
The demarcation at situational level is cognitively blocked; but at the same
time it establish an automatic control.

N.B. recent data (in collection with one of my PHD student was concerning
the establishment of every criteria in case for 320 protocols of ToH, and of
the hierarchy between them)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------
3. Goals

3.1. A first distinction relies on the presence or not of a modal verb. A
modal verb points to what I call a critical goal. If there is no modal verb
the goal runs automaticaly, controlled at situational level.
- A modal verb points the the fact that one another representation is
constructed. The participant is  detached from the current activity. In this
case other properties of the situational level are considered and the modal
verb marks the passage between enunciative and situational level .
For example in trial 2 the modal verb 'can' appears for the move of disk 2,
planned in 1. In trial 1, there was a sitational location on the peg in 2-3
: move of disk 1 was located to move of disk 2 for regrouping set of disks
1-2. In trial 2, there is an enunciative location between disk 2 and disk 1;
disk 2 is located to disk 1, with attentional centration on disk 1 and disk
2 is put in the background. But thinking of disk 1 involved disk 2. The
function of the modal verb is to make a link between enunciative level and
the situational one : thinking of disk 1 invoves disk2 at enunciative level.
But the selected disk 2 involves the solid disk 2 which itself involves its
move at situational level and therefore the move of disk 1. 


3.2 Generic goals. 
A number of observations allow me to give an inventary of different types of
goals (we'll see that later). 
A generic goal is a goal uttered one time with a general form, without
specification in the current state. so it can be applied several times when
the current state allows it.
A specific kind is the general goal which can appear either to bring every
disks to the goal peg, that is to say that first one have to bring disk 2,
then after disk 3, and only after disk 4 to peg c, and so on. And sometimes
the challenge is to bring first every disk to peg b, before to bring it to
peg c. (I remember of an adult who wanted to bring disk 3 to peg c while it
was already on peg b and disk 4 at peg c).
Another kind is to free the peg by retaking the set of disks on the peg. It
is this kind of generic and general goal appears in trial 1 in 3 with 'I can
take again'. When the generic is achieved the resolution goes on and is
extended as long as possible with attentional effects and automatic
organizations. 


4. the elementary rule is to move one disk if it is possible. Then the
action is extended and controlled by the organization either of disks or of
moves at the different levels by means of several kind inferences that I
have not yet modelized.
chunks are first organised as agregates, then as objects without elements,
then elements are extracted and organised into the whole object. 
Progressively others rules such as move a set of two disks from a peg to
another peg with a single action is constructed, and also the move of set of
three disks. It is the case in Anzai and Simon protocol. Also progressively
automatisations are constructed. But it do not appear in trials 1 and 2 of
Olivier. 

5 - Memory : I have not yet modelized the memùory of the system. I have some
hints : locations are stored in long term memory, and every thing as soon as
there is a repetition. 
Furthermore two sorts of storage or retrieval have to be distinguished;  one
is processed automatically, the other marked with interjections which appear
in different linguistic contexts works at attentional level.
Surely I have all the ingredient in order to construct a dynamic memory.
But work has to be done for that, and I have not finished to study every point.
