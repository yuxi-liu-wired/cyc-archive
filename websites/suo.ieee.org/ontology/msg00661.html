&gt; Subject: RE: SUO: RE: #s 3, 4 &amp; 5 Comments by Matthew West
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Jim, 
&gt; 	.	This has turned into a suggested set of 
&gt; alterations to the
&gt; SUO group methods of working. I believe these are pragmatic ways of
&gt; overcoming the recent hiatus that has obstructed our 
&gt; progress. You may like
&gt; to consider the approaches suggested below as ways of 
&gt; improving the SUO
&gt; development process. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Matthew et al, 
&gt; 	.		I will provide a brief note, in 
&gt; numerical order, on
&gt; each of the 3 e-mails below: 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	RE: #3 "Flawed Approach: So long as Ian Niles is
&gt; co-ordinating (and actually doing) the work, I suggest the 
&gt; structure of the
&gt; basis is, de facto, under his control, taking into account 
&gt; the input from
&gt; the rest of us. If we get to a stage where someone actually suggests a
&gt; different structure (absolute silence so far .......), and 
&gt; Ian rejects it on
&gt; a basis the majority of us disagree with, then this issue 
&gt; could be worth
&gt; revisiting. 

MW: I think what I have been proposing as a set of deliverables is an
alternative approach that in particular involves putting the horses in front
of the cart.

&gt; 
&gt; 	.	At present, Ian is showing worthwhile effort , and is
&gt; genuinely adapting participants comments in a reasonable way, 
&gt; including
&gt; taking note when there is reaction to solution paths he has 
&gt; developed in the
&gt; absence of guidance or when he has attempted to rationalise 
&gt; things himself. 

MW: I am the last to denigrate Ian's effort. At a minimum it has raised the
issues we are now discussing. One of my own mottos is "if in doubt do
something", and Ian has, and as a result we have much useful evidence of
what we need to do.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	An important aspect that Ian should continue to do, is
&gt; advising the group of every change that he makes on his own 
&gt; initiative, so
&gt; that their merits can be considered in the light of the breadth of
&gt; experience of the other group members. 

&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	I propose that Ian Niles be accepted as the 
&gt; co-ordinator and
&gt; developer of the SUO content, on the basis that no-one else 
&gt; is proposing or
&gt; offering to undertake the work. 

MW: This is a de facto situation for the work Ian is doing.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I further propose that the SUO content co-ordinator and
&gt; developer be required to advise the group of every change 
&gt; that s/he makes on
&gt; their own initiative, so that the merits of each such change can be
&gt; considered by the other group members. 

MW: It would be nice to have a way of marking changes without having to work
your way right through the document each time.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	RE: #4 'Practical Purpose': I have addressed 
&gt; the issue of
&gt; potential alternative start points several times recently. Only one
&gt; alternative has so far even been registered, but, so far, 
&gt; no-one is prepared
&gt; to champion even that. We're quite prepared to consider any 
&gt; suggestions on
&gt; their merits.

MW: And I suspect that is not the work we have done in EPISTLE which I have
mentioned several times, but continues to be totally ignored.  
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	Since you evidently feel "that what we 
&gt; currently have is too
&gt; far from something that would be an acceptable standard, that 
&gt; it does not
&gt; constitute a start point", what do you suggest as the alternative????
&gt; Numbers of us are eagerly waiting to actually hear a positive 
&gt; option rather
&gt; than just another criticism. Matthew, the ball is in your court!!

MW: In EPISTLE we have a top level (upper upper) 4D ontology. It is
currently being edited to be issued as a Draft International Standard by
ISO, so it is somewhat further forward and more coherent than our fumblings
here. Unfortunately, it is written in an entity relationship language called
EXPRESS (never mind that this is already an ISO standard) and is long on
structure and short on axioms. I have translated part of this into KIF
around the beginning of November. This is very difficult for me. As I am
sure you are aware, writing well in a language for a newcomer is much harder
than reading. It was anyway largely ignored, and now appears to be forgotten
as well, but please do not accuse me of not proposing something more solid.
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	(None was provided by Matthew) I propose that 
&gt; the current
&gt; development work by Ian Niles be continued until someone 
&gt; actually proposes a
&gt; viable alternative. 

MW: No it is just forgotten, see above.
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	RE: #5 'Email Process': I agree about the 
&gt; resourcing problem
&gt; with the more usual standards development approach you 
&gt; mention. Another
&gt; issue is that it is necessarily far slower than other 
&gt; approaches are capable
&gt; of being - that's one of the reasons the Internet is being 
&gt; taken up as a
&gt; mean of facilitating and expediting work. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	In regard to your final comment that: "We could make the
&gt; e-mail stuff work better than it does", I wish to suggest an 
&gt; oft used and
&gt; well proven approach, including in standards development. 
&gt; This is that each
&gt; comment include a "proposed solution". This works best when 
&gt; the proposed
&gt; solution provides actual suggested alternative content that 
&gt; can be readily
&gt; assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the identified problem. 
&gt; 
&gt; 	.	I suggest that, if this approach is undertaken, 
&gt; then we will
&gt; make far better and faster progress.  
&gt; 
&gt; Proposed Solution: 
&gt; 	.	I propose that all future comments on the SUO 
&gt; development
&gt; each include a "proposed solution". As far as possible, the proposed
&gt; solution is to provide actual suggested alternative content 
&gt; that can be
&gt; readily assessed for its effectiveness in overcoming the 
&gt; identified problem.
&gt; Comments that do not do this will not be ignored, but their 
&gt; adoption cannot
&gt; be achieved until a satisfactory proposed solution has been 
&gt; identified and
&gt; accepted. 

MW: So you are suggesting that only hens can tell bad eggs?

&gt; Dear Jim,
&gt; 
&gt; I think the issue here is that what we currently have is too far from

&gt; &gt; Can I also endorse Pat, John and Malcolm's 'No' votes.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; It seems to me that what has been produced - as Pat and John 
&gt; &gt; say - is not
&gt; &gt; sufficiently conceptually consistent as a basis and - as 
&gt; &gt; Matthew says - does

&gt; &gt; really a standard
&gt; &gt; that is fit for any practical purpose.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I am not sure that - as Adam suggests - the process of 
&gt; making concrete
&gt; &gt; suggestions via email is adequate for the task at hand. A 
&gt; point that a
&gt; &gt; number of people have made in the past.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I suppose that you could argue I should make a concrete 
&gt; &gt; suggestion for a way
&gt; &gt; to produce an adequate product. I think the task is of a size 
&gt; &gt; that anything
&gt; &gt; I would suggest would involve the old standards such as a 
&gt; project with
&gt; &gt; resources and a plan that gave some substance to the process 
&gt; &gt; of analysis to
&gt; &gt; be followed and the deliverables. But there is no point in 
&gt; &gt; starting this
&gt; &gt; unless there is some kind of commitment in terms of resources.
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Chris
