<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>The notice of copyright is 
a concern throughout development. Every draft version of a standard has to be 
labeled with the appropriate copyright notices. One brief notice appears on 
every page of the standard. The other appears at the beginning of the document. 
These notices are crucial to guarantee copyright protection and should not be 
overlooked. See the <A 
href="http://standards.ieee.org/guides/style/section2.html#1186"><I>IEEE 
Standards Style Manual</I></A> for the proper wording for these 
notices.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3></FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>Using material from other 
copyrighted documents is a major issue. Just as the IEEE is concerned with 
protecting its copyright, it is correspondingly concerned with respecting the 
copyright of others. If you're using material from another document, you need to 
ensure that the copyright owner has granted permission. For text, most 
organizations would consider minimal citation to be "fair use," which can be 
included without permission. When it comes to tables and figures, however, the 
distinction is harder to make. A table can be a brief way of representing a 
dense amount of information and, as the adage goes, a picture is worth a 
thousand words. For these reasons, you have to obtain permission for use of 
figures and tables from other publications. Some groups also want to use an 
entire document as the basis for their standard. In such cases, contact the <A 
href="mailto:c.stanziola@ieee.org">Manager of Standards Licensing and 
Contracts</A> in the IEEE Standards Department for guidance. </FONT></P>

Copyrighted material from other organizations</FONT> </H3>
<P><A name=519></A><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times,serif">When standards 
developers choose to use copyrighted text, tables, or figures and possibly 
modify or adapt the material to suit their needs, permission to do so shall be 
requested from the copyright owner. It is preferred, however, that copyrighted 
material be referenced rather than reprinted. Standards developers are 
encouraged to request permission from copyright owners as soon as the decision 
is made to include copyrighted material in a draft. As draft documents are made 
available to the public, it is important to acknowledge the ownership of any 
material that is not original. The following credit line shall be used in the 
event that specific language from the copyright holder is not available:</FONT> 
</P>
<P><A name=1463></A><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times,serif">&lt;Indicate 
material&gt; reprinted from &lt;copyright owner, title of publication&gt;, year 
of publication.</FONT> </P>
<P><A name=1228></A><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times,serif">Standards 
developers incorporating any previously copyrighted material into an IEEE 
standard shall obtain written permission from the copyright owner, which in most 
cases is the publisher, <I>prior</I> to submittal to the IEEE-SA Standards 
Board. Copies of the letters requesting and granting permission should be 
forwarded directly to the IEEE Standards Department and shall be included in the 
submittal to the IEEE Standards Review Committee <A 
href="http://standards.ieee.org/board/rev/index.html">(RevCom)</A>. Obtaining 
this permission is the responsibility of the sponsor; any delay in obtaining 
this will also delay publication of the standard. Sample letters of request and 
permission appear in <A 
href="http://standards.ieee.org/guides/style/annexd.html">Annex D</A>. Please 
contact the IEEE Standards Contracts Administrator with any questions about 
copyright and permission.</FONT> </P>

Submission of independently developed documents</FONT> </H3>
<P><A name=942></A><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times,serif">The submission of 
independently developed documents for consideration as potential IEEE standards 
or to serve as base documents for standards development is also encouraged. In 
order to ensure unencumbered development, from working group decisions through 
the consensus balloting process, a written permission release of unrestricted 
world rights to use a document as the basis for development of an IEEE standard 
and for all future revisions and editions of that standard is required. The 
process of standards development may result in changes to the base document; the 
IEEE must maintain the right to amend the document as it sees fit to meet the 
needs of this process. </FONT></P>
<P><A name=2672></A><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times,serif">In some cases, use 
of an independently developed document as a potential IEEE standard may require 
that the IEEE obtain a license agreement from the copyright owner allowing 
development and distribution of the standard. The copyright owner may also 
require that IEEE pay royalties or other valuable considerations on the use and 
distribution of the independently developed document. Therefore, it is 
recommended that the IEEE Standards staff be notified as early in the process as 
possible so that the staff will have sufficient time to make necessary 
arrangements.</FONT> </P>
<P><A name=2677></A><FONT face="Times New Roman, Times,serif">It is also 
recognized that, in giving permission to use the document as the basis for an 
IEEE standard, the copyright owner(s) do not forfeit the copyright to their 
original text and its future development outside of the IEEE; however, the 
copyright owner(s) must agree not to refer to their document as an IEEE 
standard. The copyright owner(s) will be credited for their initial development 
of the base document in the front matter of the approved IEEE standard. Contact 
the IEEE Standards Contracts Administrator to obtain a copy of the approved 
letter to certify the copyright release, or, if necessary, a license 
agreement.</FONT> </P></DIV>
