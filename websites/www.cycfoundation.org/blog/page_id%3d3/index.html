<p><strong>John De Oliveira</strong><br/>John De Oliveira is accountable for the strategic direction of the Cyc Foundation in its efforts to grow and disseminate an open knowledge-based asset. John initiated the OpenCyc project within Cycorp in the late 1990s and led the effort to release the entire OpenCyc ontology to the open source community in 2006. OpenCyc, is the world&#8217;s largest structured vocabulary of general purpose terminology, and it has been downloaded over 60,000 times. He also started the ResearchCyc project, which makes the entire Cyc technology available for free for research purposes.John has worked for over 20 years in information technology. He is currently Senior Technical Product Manager at Hoover&#8217;s, Inc. and co-founder of ActionItem.com. Before his 8 years at Cycorp, he was Executive Director of IT for a leading direct marketing retailer. He has a BA in English from LeMoyne College and is pursuing an MBA in market strategy at Regis University.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Mark Baltzegar</span><br/>A community builder and advocate for openly sharing knowledge, <a href="http://www.markbaltzegar.com" title="Mark Baltzegar's Profile" target="_blank">Mark</a> established the first OpenCyc users’ group in 2004 to acquaint a wider audience with structured knowledge representation and its applications. Mark is the former Technical Lead at <a href="http://www.terraincognita.com" title="Terra Incognita Productions" target="_blank">Terra Incognita Productions</a> where he applied his passion for interactive and educational technology on behalf of leading cultural institutions. Before joining Terra Incognita, Mark was also an award-winning art director and designer working in print, video, film and animation. His work has been honored with numerous awards including the New York Films International Festival Gold Medal, CODiE, Webby, Telly and Emmy awards, and has been recognized in <em>HOW</em> and <em>Communication Arts</em> magazines.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Bouldin</strong><br/>Brad Bouldin is a founding member of the Cyc Foundation, and has been active in development of projects such as the OpenCyc-to-Wikipedia Linking Project, the Cyclopedia browser, and has developed the web services tier for accessing the Cyc server. Brad assists with system architecture tasks for these projects, such as performance testing the Cyc web services, and has also helped with deployment of the OWL representation of OpenCyc. Recently Brad has worked with Cycorp to develop a means of subsetting the OpenCyc ontology, to produce domain-specific OWL ontologies (such as an ontology of the computer industry that includes general business terms and computer-related terms and properties). Brad is a ResearchCyc licensee, and pursues an interest in semantic-tagging and natural language generation.Brad works in IBM&#8217;s WebSphere lab services group, where he has consulted with Fortune-500 companies on their e-commerce architectures over the last 10 years. He lately has been developing reusable code-generation patterns for consultants and customers. Currently his focus is on developing model driven development techniques for code generation, and using semantic systems (including the OpenCyc ontology) for various purposes including code generation, knowledge engineering, and asset classification.<strong></p>
<p>Vijay Raj</strong><br/>Vijay has been involved with Cyc Foundation since it began. He has written the algorithm to map the Wikipedia articles to Cyc concepts. His core interests are exploring algorithms to enhance Cyc knowledge automatically, mapping concepts between disconnected ontologies and identifying immediate, real world applications for Cyc knowledge base.Vijay holds a bachelors degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, India and Masters degree in Electrical Engineering from University of Colorado at Boulder. He works for a reputed telecommunications company designing physical layer algorithms for advanced wireless communications technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Arturo Hernandez</strong><br/>Arturo Hernandez was part of the original Austin Cyclify group since 2004, and now part of the Cyc Foundation since its formation. He has been involved in the design and implementation of multiple database systems, covering all aspects from leadership to design and implementation. His current interest is to find better ways to implement information systems, and Cyc presents a great opportunity.He believes the Cyclopedia Project is of particular interest. And it represents a new kind of knowledge sharing that can provide the whole internet community with common sense structured knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Kino High Coursey</strong><br/>Kino has followed the Cyc project since its inception, and uses ResearchCyc at his company Daxtron Labs and in his academic research. Kino has a Masters in Computer Science from the University of North Texas where he is working toward a PhD with a focus on natural language processing and artificial intelligence, and a Bachelors in Computer Science from the University of Texas in Austin.Kino has explored the use of Cyc for providing knowledge for chatbots, as well as guide machine learning tools, and direct simulated characters and environments. His thesis was on the using Cyc&#8217;s existing knowledge to organize the classification of Wikipedia articles for linking those articles to Cyc&#8217;s ontology. He is currently researching unifying the use of Cyc knowledge and Wikipedia, and utilizing both to generate unique solutions using existing fragments of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Larry Lefkowitz</strong><br/>Larry has served as the liaison between Cycorp and the Cyc Foundation since its inception. His primary role has been coordinating the overlapping but distinct goals of the two organizations. At Cycorp, in addition to heading up the ResearchCyc initiative and working with the Foundation, Larry is Executive Director for Business Development with responsibility for the successful commercialization of the Cyc technology.Prior to joining Cycorp, Larry had led numerous knowledge-based system initiatives in both academia and industry. He co-founded the Laboratory for Computer-Supported Cooperative Work at the University of Massachusetts, where he directed research in the areas of artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, planning, and plan recognition. While with Bellcore’s Computer Technology Transfer organization, Larry led a team in the development of a state-of-the-art Intelligent Tutoring System for training in complex operations environments. He is the author of numerous technical publications in Computer and Information Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Intelligent Tutoring Systems. In addition to his R&amp;D efforts, Larry has consulted globally helping companies implement technology-based solutions.Larry received his PhD in Computer and Information Science from the University of Massachusetts (Amherst, MA).</p>
